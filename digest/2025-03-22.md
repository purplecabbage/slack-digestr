__@dpogue__ says 
> Regarding SDK 35+ and Android Edge-to-Edge stuff, if you grab the Android WebView Canary channel, it should properly support `safe-area-inset` properties now (when the webview is sized to fill the entire device screen) rather than always setting them to 0px. If that doesn't cause compatibility issues for apps, it should make its way to the release version in a few months

__@dpogue__ says 
> One thing to be aware of if you're using plugins to grab the insets and add them manually is that you could potentially get double the padding now. I'm hoping that's an easy thing to detect and work around (CSS `max(var, falback_var)` should be helpful here) because the Android WebView team will revert the change (or restrict it to certain API levels) if they get complaints about it breaking apps.
