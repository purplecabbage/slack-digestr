__@jc0110cj__ says 
> I'm getting a "Command CodeSign failed"  error when I try to run anything built with 8 beta.1.  Current release builds work fine.  I created a native iOS app:  worked fine.  Created a new beta 8 app: same problem.  This may be some weirdness with my just software updated Mac (m4 mini) but I thought I'd check in here to see if anyone else is seeing this.
