__@norman137__ says 
> im pretty sure apple hates polyfills...
> 
> Spent my entire day debugging an issue with the screen orientation, it happens rarely on our apps but the `.lock` is sometimes undefined. It happens on 16.4+ so it has somethign to do with Apple's partial implementation of screen orientation.
> 
> What's more interesting is in a barebones hello world app, the issue is consistently reproducible. Something overwrites screen.orientation object, and well there are no other plugins at play so the only culprit would be safari itself.
> 
> The overwrite happens at some point after document load and after device ready.... if you test for `screen.orientation.lock` in `deviceready` it exists, but then you go and look at in web inspector and it doesn't exist and the entire object is overwritten (observable if you modify the plugin to attach random properties on `screen.orientation`)
> 
> At work, we are changing the clobbers so it doesn't try to overwrite `screen.orientation` and everything is fine, but it seems like trying to polyfill `screen.orientation` is not reliable on iOS 16.4+ 😕

__@norman137__ says 
> Another metric is if I refresh the webview then it "works".
> 
> It might not be safari iteslf but the act of polyfilling too early when WKWebView is initializing or something

> Might be a solution... I was trying to use this to learn exactly where the other set is coming from but by doing this it seems to prevent an overwrite????

__@jcesarmobile__ says

__@jcesarmobile__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@jcesarmobile__ says

__@ebrommers__ says 
> Not sure if this qn should be in plugins or here. There appears to be some change in `cordova-plugin-file` between v.6.0.2 and 8.0.0 in the way directoryEntry.toURL() returns the directory string for `cordova.file.dataDirectory`.
> 
> `cordova-plugin-file@6.0.2` directoryEntry.toURL(): `file:///data/user/0/&lt;my app&gt;/files/`
> `cordova-plugin-file@8.0.0` directoryEntry.toURL(): `<https://localhost/__cdvfile_files__/>`
> 
> I've got a call in my app to open a SQLite DB in the dataDirectory, and this change has broken the call. 😕 Is there some guidance into what we should be using instead?

__@norman137__ says 
> historical toURL was for embedding URLS in the dom and with all the scheme stuff, file/cdvfile doesn't work since its cross-origin. That's why toURL now returns a https:// url on android.
> 
> I think there is a `.nativeURL` property if I recall correctly that should be the `file:///` path
