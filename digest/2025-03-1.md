> the old `cdvfile:` urls were replaced because they no longer work with modern webviews/cross-origin restrictions. So `.toURL()` now returns something that will be same-origin.

> What you suspect, that `cdvfile_persistent` isn't mapped properly is definitely a possibility (it should be handled via <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/src/android/FileUtils.java#L1249>). If you are able to prepare a sample reproduction app that can prove/demonstrate that this is the case, we then could use that to build a test case and patch the issue.

> I believe the "persisistent" storage is simply just the "files" directory inside the dataDirectory, so you could try resolving `window.resolveResolveLocalURL(window.cordova.dataDirectory + "files/video_file_a4bb08.mp4", (fileEntry) =&gt; { ... }, (error) =&gt; { ... });` as a workaround. It should get a slightly different URL that ends up leading to the same place as `LocalFilesystem.PERSISTENT`
