__@prasunjajodia__ says 
> @marek.kozela, Electron doesn't support using node libraries in your Front end JS files as of cordova-electron 3 and above.
> As Normal pointed out in your stackoverflow question, you should be able to make a simple electron plugin for your needs...
> Here's something to get you started <https://erisu.dev/posts/creating-a-plugin-for-apache-cordova-electron/>
> Feel free to ask more questions when you need.
