__@lauben2814y__ says 
> Thanks @senthilnathan but the problem is it doesn't play my mkv files. I tried <http://plyr.io|plyr.io> but still the same. Sometimes they play but no video like the audio. It seems players based on the native video player don't support mkv.

__@dpogue__ says 
> mkv is not a supported video format in browsers. If it's possible to transcode the files to something like mp4, webm, or av1, that would work with the built-in video player and have hardware acceleration for faster decoding with less power consuption
