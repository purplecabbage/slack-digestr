__@jc0110cj__ says 
> I haven't look deeply into Beta 8 since my plugins didn't have any serious problems with it but I'm wondering if there have been any changes in the embedding model.  I have a plugin that frames WebViews in native split or tab views--gives my apps a native look that is hard to fake in a WebView--but I  have to spend an extra startup WebView if I don't embed Cordova to use my plugin.  My current embedding approach is to manually insert my own startup code.  Works for me but it would be nice if I could offer more friendly approach to other users.

__@dpogue__ says 
> I don't think there have been any changes that would impact that. CDVViewController still initializes its full-screen webview when it's shown. We did change the default app template to move to using Xcode storyboards for initializing that view controller, but that shouldn't make a difference.

__@dpogue__ says 
> I wonder if making a custom subclass of CDVViewController that set up the UINavigationController might work for your case? You could override how that initial webview is created and make it happen in a tab instead of the main view

> Maybe it requires an updated webview component? Tried using a Google Play image with it logged into Google Play store so that it can receive all the latest component updates?

__@dpogue__ says 
> There was an API mentioned on the docs page about "System ~gesture~ bars insets" that I think might be worth looking into... maybe we can opt the webview into those (although I'm not sure the webview knows or cares)
> I also want to check if we can safe-area-inset stuff working on older versions in immersive mode, but unlikely to have time to look into any of this until mid-Feb
