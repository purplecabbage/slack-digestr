__@dpogue__ says 
> `:user-invalid` seems pretty thrilling... been wanting that for almost 10 years. Shame I'll need to wait another 4 for it to actually work on all supported iOS versions (and Chrome still doesn't support it at all)

> It's gotten pretty stale, it was never merged cause usually we want at least two PMC members to give a review.

> However if you're trying to use it as a workaround to safe area insets, it's not even sufficient. It will get you the top area inset, but it won't get you left/right/bottom.
> 
> My workplace created a plugin for that problem called `@totalpave/cordova-plugin-insets` (<https://github.com/totalpaveinc/cordova-plugin-insets>)
> 
> It's implemented for android-only because iOS has native support for safe area insets. The android plugin offers an API to either get the last known inset information or to listen to inset changes (which will happen on orientation change for example).
> 
> It doesn't do anything more then that, so if you want to use the values from CSS like the `safe-area-*` css values, you'll need to bind them yourself. We didn't do that ourselves because binding CSS is incredibly slow, so instead we just adjusted our root app container accordingly.
