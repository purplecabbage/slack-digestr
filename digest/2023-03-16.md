__@norman137__ says 
> Cordova is kind of designed so that your app code is for the most part cross-platform. The big thing about migrating to cordova-electron is whether the plugins you currently are using has electron (or at least cordova-browser) support.

__@ppetree__ says 
> Hi All! I've been away for a year (dealing with the big C) and I'm getting back to work on a couple of apps I have.  Pretty much everything has to be upgraded which, so far hasn't been too bad. However, one in particular seems hopelessly out of date:  *cordova-plugin-googlemaps* - does anyone know what the current way of implementing google maps in the apps is?

__@norman137__ says 
> gmaps doesn't work out of the box, there are opened PRs to make it compatible, so you could fork and merge those PRs yourself.

> You'll need to however pin to `b00beec7b83f79ae4f5bb068da54edbc1e2e9cf6` and it's not going to be maintained any further (the next commit adds in a dependency on a proprietary C++ module, so it won't be usable)

__@ppetree__ says 
> Thanks Norman. I'm pretty much like you, I fork them and then eventually find a better way and then forget them and then after a while delete the fork. LOL

> I'm using volt.build (thank god I don't have to update the entire build engine and workflow!) so I'll have to figure out how to add it as a &lt;plugin url&gt;. That url param still in the spec?

__@ppetree__ says 
> I think it's pretty much like running cordova locally just cloud based. At one point they didn't allow hooks but that was when they first started out but all of that (to my knowledge) has been resolved. I could always ask @gh.

__@norman137__ says

__@gh__ says

__@ppetree__ says
