__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> I am using cordova-plugin-file-transfer on iOS to download files, but it seems is not passing along all the cookies so I am getting a 422 error, I cannot set the cookie header manually since the cookie is flagged secure therefore I cannot get it in document.cookies.

> I donâ€™t know how this was working before, since I didnâ€™t change anything on the js sideâ€¦ any ideas?

__@erisu__ says 
> Might be something to do with Apple security changes...

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:47:44 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> For example starting in iOS 14 and onwards ITP is enabled..

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:48:17 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> as far as the protocol goes, you'll need at minimum `SameSite=none; Secure` cookie for third-party cookies, but iOS has additional security mechanisms called ITP which allows users to completely block third-party cookies (and maybe first-party cookies too?)
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:48:22 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> Which blocks cross-site web tracking so cookies most likely not transfer over..
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:50:03 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> By default ITP is enabled and the option to disable it is not shown for your app in the App Settings.
> 
> There is a info.plist entry you can add to enable the setting to appear in the App settings, but the user must go to the settings screen to disable ITP to allow third-party cookies.
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:51:37 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> So if third-party cookies are critical part of your solution, then you'll going to have to re-architecture your solution on iOS so that it's not based on cookies. Because otherwise you'll need to put a lot of emphasis to persuade (and guide) your users to disable that security feature, which is also probably against Apple terms of service, knowing Apple...

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> aha, it was httpOnly not secure flag, sorry, the thing is http requests on the browser are working just fine, itâ€™s just cordova-plugin-file-transfer thatâ€™s not working. So like the plugin is not getting cookies from the webview or something like that.

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> I am trying this: Cartegraph/cordova-cookie-master (<http://github.com|github.com><https://github.com/Cartegraph/cordova-cookie-master|)> but it doesnâ€™t seem to get all the cookies (the httpOnly one)

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:58:14 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The restrictions only really applies third-party cookies
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:59:38 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> well actually, cookies is a browser concept... file transfer uses a non-browser based HTTP connection
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:59:38 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> what do you mean by third party cookies?
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:00:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> a third-party cookie is when you make a request to a server that sets a cookie on the request, but that request does not equal the origin of the loaded document, which is typically the case in cordova apps because generally speaking you have your app bundled locally.
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:01:29 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> whereas on the browser, if you load up <http://example.com|example.com>, and you make a request to <http://example.com|example.com> that sets a cookie, the origin and the server matches, which produces a "first-party" cookie which security restrictions are relaxed in that kind of situation.
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:01:56 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> aha, ok
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:02:24 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> yeah, in that case it is since it is <ionic://subdomain.domain.com> making a request to <https://subdomain.domain.com>
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:02:48 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> but whatâ€™s weird is that webview wiseâ€¦ itâ€™s working just fine
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:04:29 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah so that's a cross-origin request
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:04:34 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> which makes cookies third-party
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:06:47 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If the webview itself is making the request, the request itself may work fine, given proper CORS configuration on the server, but `Set-Cookie` needs at minimum `SameSite=none; Secure;`
> 
> `SameSite=none` allows cookie to be set cross-origin (spec default is `Lax` which allows the cookie to be set, but not readable by the origin). Using `SameSite=none` has an additional requirement of `Secure;` flag which means hte cookie can only be set in HTTPS secure protocol.
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:07:12 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> But honestly if you're using the file transfer plugin, idk how much of that applies because you're not using the web-based request
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:08:27 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> but im not familiar with how the file transfer plugin works tbh, so maybe it tries to do some hacky way to sync cookies
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:11:39 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> is SameSite=none; Secure (and also httpOnly)
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:11:52 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> `Path=/; Expires=Mon, 04 Dec 2023 11:50:31 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None`
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:18:39 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> can you clarify if the cookie is being created by the file transfer download request via the server response, or cookie is already created in the webview and is not being sent to the server?
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 12:19:08 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Like is it incoming cookie that's not being synced, or is it an outgoing cookie that isn't being synced?
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:52:17 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> itâ€™s already created in the webview, not in the file transfer download

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:52:35 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> Iâ€™ve checked that if I set up de cookie as a header, everything works fine
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:52:50 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> however, I do not have access to that cookie programatically
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:53:09 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> so the issue is that your webserver isn't receiving that cookie in it's request header
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:53:21 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> like file transfer isn't sending in that cookie header on your download request

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:55:06 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> the file-transfer apparently doesnâ€™t know about the webview cookies (that I tested it with my old app too, however it is sending the final request with the cookies because it gets the file)

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:55:47 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> Iâ€™ve tested on the new version (with everything updated cordova-ios and plugins) that if I set a header my self with the cookie, everything works fine
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:56:07 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> however, as the cookie is httpOnly, I cannot get it with document.cookies
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:56:37 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> Iâ€™ve also tried the following:
> ```        // Retrieve the shared cookie storage
>         NSHTTPCookieStorage *sharedCookieStorage = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage];

>                   [cookie path]);
>         }```
> and other cookies are present but not the session one which is httpOnly
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:57:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> right, so if you manually set the header with the cookie that you expect to be present, it works. But that's not a solution since you can't actually read that dynamically.
> 
> So the file transfer request isn't forwarding the cookie from the webview
> 

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:57:33 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says 
> if I were able to get that cookie, I would be able to bypass this, since I can programmatically send the http cookie header

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:57:42 GMT

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:57:45 GMT

__@pablo.caselas__ says

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 15:59:16 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> natively the request in file transfer is not the browser, so natively it doesn't know about cookies from the webview. But Erisu and I was kinda poking around and we see that there seems to be some intent to sync the cookies for the request, so it sounds like that part isn't working

Tue, 05 Sep 2023 16:04:43 GMT
