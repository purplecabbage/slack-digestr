__@andrew071__ says 
> Has anyone experienced issues with their app becoming very slow at startup over time to the point where users start receiving retry/network issues, but if a user deletes and downloads the app again then it immediately works perfectly.   Mostly looking for some tips on how to start to troubleshoot this as none of our engineers can reproduce the issue.
> 
> We can sorta reproduce it if we put our phones via xcode under thermal load or very poor network, but this doesn’t quite match actual user experience, because real users can delete the app, download the app again and then log back in to the app (which does even more network requests then on resume) faster then sitting and waiting for the app to load when it is experiencing the issue.  So if it was thermal/performance/network issues from the user side I don’t expect they would be able to do all those steps faster then waiting for the couple of network requests that happen on resume.

> ```Photos and videos on a user’s device are regarded as personal and sensitive user data subject to Google Play's User Data policy. Apps may only access photos and videos for purposes directly related to app functionality, and may not request access on behalf of any third-party for any purpose unrelated to user-facing app functionality. For a more privacy preserving experience, we encourage the use of a system picker such as the photo picker.

> Basically unless if you're building a gallery app or can justify that you need persistent/broad use of video/image file access on external storage, these permissions cannot be in your manifest file. So at some point I think we'll need to remove these permissions from the file plugin and make them opt in.... Kind of reinforces my desire to strip external storage support on the file plugin for android in favour for a media store plugin, and keep the file plugin internal storage use only.

__@norman137__ says 
> For some reason I thought we added the `READ_` permissions to the file plugin, but it looks like we didn't. We just use them but we don't set up the manifest declaration, so I guess we are already "opt" in
