__@slack1470__ says 
> I've just had weeks with similar issues on a project and onesignal plugin. my suggestions are:
> 
> Make sure that CocoaPods is correctly installed and integrated with your Cordova project. You can do this by navigating to the iOS platform directory of your project and running `pod install` to ensure that the pods are properly installed.
> Check if the `Pods` folder exists in your iOS project directory and that it contains the AWSCore library.
> 
> Ensure that your Podfile is correctly configured. It should be located in the `platforms/ios` directory and look something like this:
> ```platform :ios, '10.0' 
> use_frameworks! 
> target 'CocoapodsTestApp' do 
>    pod 'AWSCore'
> end```
> After updating the Podfile, run `pod install` or `pod update` in the `platforms/ios` directory.
