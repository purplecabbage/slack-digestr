__@jeriel.ng__ says 
> Hey all, I’m currently integrating some unit tests on my iOS/Android project via `cordova-plugin-test-framework`. From what I understand, you’re supposed to execute these tests by adding a link to `cdvtests/index.html` and then run your app. Is there a way I can do this headless without having to launch an app? I’d like to be able to execute these tests simply on the CLI as part of a CI/CD pipeline
