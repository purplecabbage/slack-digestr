__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Why is Xcode on Apple Silicon giving me this error when building for iOS simulator? *`Build failed because libCordova.a is missing a required architecture. Would you like to build for Rosetta instead?`*

__@norman137__ says 
> I'd make sure you're not excluding arm64 in your `Excluded Architectures` Build Settings (Unless if you have a really good reason this setting should be blank).
> 
> Additionally your `Architectures` setting should include both `arm64` and `x86_64` for siulator builds, or it should be set to `$(ARCHS_STANDARD)`
> 
> Just a couple of things to double check.
> 
> The error basically means that the library doesn't have arm64 symbols, which is required for silicon macs since they are arm64 chips.

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> @norman137 Thanks, you're right. I copy-pasted some podfile code off stackoverflow because I was getting the same error on other libraries:
> *Build failed because CocoaLumberjack.tbd, FBLPromises.tbd, FirebaseABTesting.tbd, FirebaseCore.tbd, FirebaseCoreExtension.tbd, FirebaseCoreInternal.tbd, FirebaseCrashlytics.tbd, FirebaseDynamicLinks.tbd, FirebaseInstallations.tbd, FirebaseRemoteConfig.tbd, FirebaseSessions.tbd, GTMSessionFetcher.tbd, GoogleDataTransport.tbd, GoogleToolboxForMac.tbd, GoogleUtilities.tbd, GoogleUtilitiesComponents, Promises.tbd, and nanopb.tbd are missing a required architecture. Would you like to build for Rosetta instead?*

__@norman137__ says 
> it means those libraries are also missing the arm64 symbols and since unlike cordova, you probably don't build them yourself so you're probably need to get a newer version

__@norman137__ says 
> Google maps SDK for an example only introduced m1 support in a fairly recent release.
> 
> So depending on how actively maintain those packages are they may have a version built with arm64 symbols. I'd expect the Google / Firebase libraries to have a version with m1 support available at some pont but Fareclock, Promises, nanopb those are questionable.

__@norman137__ says 
> If they don't provide binaries with arm64 included in your iphonesimulator variant of their libraries, then you may need to fork their project and build a version with arm64 support enabled yourself.
> 
> And if they are closed source packages without arm64 support, then there isn't much you can do other than try running under rosetta, or use a physical device to test.

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 19:25:16 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Ok, thanks. It does work with Rosetta, but wanted to avoid it.

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 19:28:17 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, better if you can run it under the native machine code.

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> They seem to all support arm64, because otherwise they wouldn't run on iOS devices, right? Does the simulator on Apple Silicon run the same exact arm64 libraries, or it there some other variant it needs?
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:37:09 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> No the problem is pre apple silicon there was 2 variants:
> 
> 1. iphoneos variant, which only had arm64 as a valid architecture
> 2. iphonesimulator variant, which only had x86_64 as a valid architecture since macs only came with intel chips.
> When apple silicon/m1 chips started rolling out, those are arm64 chips. So iphonesimulator now needed to support x86_64 and arm64.
> 
> This meant that anybody who distributes frameworks that includes the iphonesimulator varient needed to also build to include both architectures to support debugging on apple silicon macs.
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:39:48 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> So if you have a framework that isn't shipping an arm64 architecture in the iphonesimulator variant, you won't be able to use that framework on a arm64 iphone simulator. Which is why it prompts you to run under rosetta (which translates x86_64 -&gt; arm64).
> 
> However if you're testing with a physical device, then you'll be using an iphoneos variant of the framework which will have arm64 and will match the architecture of the ios device. iOS have used arm64 for the longest time now, where other arm architectures aren't really a thing. Like armeabi (32-bit arm) predates iOS 11.

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> What is a "variant"? Is that an abstraction for a set of binaries necessary to run on a particular type of device? Is it visible in the build settings? So there's no way to tell Xcode to use arm64 for iossimulator if the 3rd party pod says it only supports x86 on the simulator?
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:48:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> im using the term variant, the term is not really used in xcode I don't think but in the sense when you're building a framework or an app (or any binary really) there needs to be more than 1 version of it.
> 
> There is a version for physical ios devices (called `iphoneos`) and then there is a version for the simulator (called `iphonesimulator`)
> 
> Out of those 2 versions, there is also a version for each architecture. `iphoneos` only supports 1 architecture which is `arm64`. And `iphonesimulator` can support `arm64` and `x86_64`.
> 
> A binary built with the `iphoneos` sdk cannot be ran on the iphone simulator. Likewise, a binary built with the `iphonesimulator` sdk cannot be ran on a physical iOS device, even if they both contain `arm64` symbols.

__@norman137__ says 
> &gt; So there's no way to tell Xcode to use arm64 for iossimulator if the 3rd party pod says it only supports x86 on the simulator
> No, because you can't run `x86_64` code on an `arm64` processor.
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:49:31 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> So xcode will verify that your frameworks/binaries and whatever what you're importing into your app has `arm64` symbols. If it's missing that's when it will prompt and ask if you want to run under rosetta instead.
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:50:22 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Regarding the last part, I was asking if there's a way to tell Xcode to run the arm64 binary on the simulator even though the framework wants to run x86. It seems the answer is no.
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:51:21 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Right, arm64 macs has rosetta so the only way to run the binary on an arm64 simulator when the binary has missing arm64 symbols is to run under rosetta, which translates the x86 symbols into arm64
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:51:31 GMT

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> I don't understand what the point of EXCLUDED_ARCHS is, if it won't include what you want anyway.

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:52:11 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If you were on an intel mac with a framework that had arm64 symbols but missing x86 symbols, then it just simply wouldn't run, there is no "rosetta" to translate arm64 -&gt; x86
> 

Thu, 24 Aug 2023 20:52:48 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> `EXCLUDED_ARCHS` is mostly so if you were on arm64 mac and you're just building to test locally, then you can exclude building x86_64

__@norman137__ says
