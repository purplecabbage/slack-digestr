> Hi,
> I have a problem with ios part of my application. I need to redirect to start page (content tag in config.xml) when backend is redirecting me to certain url. I don't have access to backend implmentation so i need to use this what it is doing. On Android I'm using `onOverrideUrlLoading` method in my plugin. On iOS i want to use `shouldOverrideLoadWithRequest` but I've got a problem. When I'm intercepting redirect it is redirecting to startup page but two alert are showing. One with message "frame load interrupted" and second which has information that I can't redirect. I don't know how to face this.
> Below  I've paste code which I've write:
> ```- (BOOL)shouldOverrideLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest*)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {
>     NSRange range = [request.URL.absoluteString rangeOfString:@".*mobile.html.*"
>                                                       options:NSRegularExpressionSearch];

>     if (range.location != NSNotFound) {
>         NSURLRequest* redirectReq = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:@"<httpsionic://localhost>" cachePolicy:NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy timeoutInterval:20.0]
> 		[self.webViewEngine loadRequest:redirectReq]
>         return NO;
>     }
>     return YES;
> }```
> Can someone could help me how to achieve this that I will be redirected to start page when something is returned in backend?
