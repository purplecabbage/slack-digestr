__@info460__ says 
> Hello everyone, I have a strange error not sure how to approach that.
> I am using the UiKit library with my apps, so far no problem. Recently I upgraded to Cordova 13 and I am getting this error (but just on ANdroid 5-7, new phones do not have it for some reason)
> Anyone know how I can deal with this?
> I was trying to simplify the code and at the end looks like if I use any component from the UiKit library I get this error.
> 
> I was using the same code in Codepen but there is no error shown. SO have to do something with Cordova environment?
> Thank you for any comment.

__@norman137__ says 
> It means that your device is running a webview that doesn't have the array `flat` method available: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat> which is available since chrome 69.
> 
> android 5 will ship with like chrome 30, and has a maxium webview version of somewheres late 60s early 70s, I kinda forget but it's possible that even if you update the webview that you can't get support for the `flat` API. You will need to find a polyfill most likely if you want to support android 5. cordova-android@13 does not support android 5 by default.
> 
> Android 7 ships with chrome 53 but you can get it updated to the modern webview. Chromium has cutoff the webview and ht elatest versions has API 26 (Android 8 ) as a minimum, but Android 7 can still get a relatively modern webview version, but you will have to rely on your users keeping their phone up to date.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you use a Google Play enabled simulator you can log into google play and get the simulator "updated" to the latest version of the webview that API level supports.

__@info460__ says 
> Thank you Norman, at least I know what is going on and that its not affecting newer phones.
> 
> Now I need to decide if I go to include this polyfill solution (which seems to be not 100% as it produces some glitches) or just thow the users with old phones overboard (which I dont like much either)
