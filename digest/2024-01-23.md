__@peter.cutting__ says 
> I have a google map on a react iOS/Android/web app. I had explicitely specified map API v3.51. Recently the iOS map stopped displaying (Android and web still work). It looks like v3.51 has been retired by Google and so the "weekly" version is used instead (currently 3.55) and on iOS this gets an error (see below) and the map is not displayed. I have tested the versions:- 3.52 and 3.53 work, while 3.54+ do not work on iOS. I wonder if anyone else has seen this. I know that it is a bad idea to specify a version as this will eventually be retired but its the only way to get it to work. and in a few months 3.53 will be retired and then there is currently no workaround.
