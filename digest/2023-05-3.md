__@norman137__ says 
> If we don't specify a particular resolution for an app icon, the project may contain the cordova icon in its place. Is there a particular way to "unset" or make cordova not write out the default icon?

> Apple just rejected my app cause I have a bunch of cordova icons in my app... even though I don't think they are actually displayed on any iphone we support.

__@dpogue__ says 
> <https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/pull/1309> should resolve that problem, by using only a single 1024x1024 icon

__@dpogue__ says 
> You could, in the meantime, provide a 1024x1024 icon, and use `resource-file` or a hook to overwrite the xcassets Contents.json file?

__@norman137__ says 
> In fact we already have a fork that has some unreleased changes so that we are using, so maybe we'll just pull in PR 1309 and give that a test

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> Lol, was actually thinking about closing it because the push icon comment made me think some people would not want the new behavior and would prefer to have different icons for some cases. 
> Looked into making both options possible, but would need a refactor since at the moment the code just fills the existing contents.json and would require to generate it

__@dpogue__ says 
> yeah... it would be nice to default to the single icon, and maybe do some sort of fallback if multiple icons are specified (but then you have Norman's case where it expects icons that aren't provided)

> Hi all, as we all probably know Google's bumping their Api level to 33 (in August), which is currently unsupported by Cordova version 11.
> Is there any way to manually target Api level 33 as it currently stands?

__@dpogue__ says

__@dpogue__ says

__@marko.madikj__ says
