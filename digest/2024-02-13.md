__@psnizhko__ says 
> Hi everyone
> I want to add a new scheme in my project where Cordova is used. For example, I simply duplicated my existing schema in build configuration and gave it a name 'Adhoc', and I used the same build-debug.xcconfig. However, for some reason, it couldn't find files from my library when I'm trying to build with the 'Adhoc' scheme but for 'Debug' it works. What could be the reason?
