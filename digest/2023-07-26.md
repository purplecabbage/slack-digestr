__@matt509__ says 
> I have been using Cordova since it was PhoneGap from Nitobi.  I was searching about Cordova today and saw several articles written in 2021 that Apache Corodova was being retired and to use other frameworks.  That appears to not be true.  I do recall that the Apache group mentioning something about Cordova being moved out of their main libraries or something along those lines.  However, from the activity on <https://cordova.apache.org/> it appears that Cordova is alive and well.  Can someone clarify why articles were written about Cordova like that?  When searching for "is apache cordova dead" all that comes up is article after article saying it is retired and devs should move on - mostly written in 2021.

__@dpogue__ says 
> Cordova is still actively developed and maintained, but mostly by volunteers in their spare time rather than by companies sponsoring full-time development. So the development pace is slower than in the past.

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah, basically different companies stated they are no longer supporting Cordova builds in whatever product solution they had. The apache cordova project itself is still healthy and maintained. But headlines makes it appear as if Apache Cordova itself is sunsetting, which is not the case.
