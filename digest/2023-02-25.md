__@norman137__ says 
> Looks like you're using angular, and I'm definitely not an expect but I do know that you have to ensure that you only update scopes inside the angular cycle.

> As an example, if you're using the angular on click event to update scope, angular should detect the changes and update the DOM accordingly. However if you have an angular on click hook that for exmaple uses `setTimeout` to update the scope, out of context, angular may not pick up on those changes, even though the scope may have the changes, angular may not update the DOM as a result of that change.
