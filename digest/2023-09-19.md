__@norman137__ says 
> basically if you try to set the splashscreen before the splashscreen stuff is completley dismissed (which will be at some undeterminable time after calling `.hide` on the splashscreen) then the splashscreen compat library ends up messing with the status bar state.

__@daviesd__ says

Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:26:25 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> that's kind of odd... Android 12 is when splashscreens was introduced in android, so android 12+ devices have "native" support. To bring that same splashscreen system to older devices, Cordova uses google's compat library, so you should see the same or similar behaviour with Android 9 and Android 10, or at least that would be my expectation.

__@norman137__ says 
> If it is what I expect, e.g. the race condition, a simple way to prove it is to delay your `StatusBar.overlaysWebView(false)` in a timeout, you may also have to flip it true / false to make sure that instance variables aren't blocking actual changes.

__@norman137__ says 
> my post theme solution I think doesn't guarentee that the stauts bar will be overlaid, I think it just guarentees that it will be transparent... so idk if it will be a complete solution, you'll have to test to make sure that the status bar is still an overlay.
