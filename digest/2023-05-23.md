> Hi! I see that cordova-android 12.0.0 was tagged, but the new release is not yet available on npm. Is it intentional or just an oversight? Thanks!

__@norman137__ says 
> `12.0.0` tag is a RC tag for a vote.

__@norman137__ says 
> For cordova-android@12 I think we have enough +1 from PMC members to make a release, but it's generally on the person preparing the release to close the vote and continue forward, which they'll do on their own free/volunteer time. So we should be seeing a release soon, unless if someone does a rejection.

> Votes are still welcome by non-PMC members, their votes will be considered non-binding however (e.g. a non-PMC community member would not hold power to veto a vote, but their vote would still be considered advisory and will definitely be taken into consideration)
