__@erikyuzwa__ says 
> hey all - looking to upgrade an older `cordova-ios` project to `6.3.0` and just can't connect to the app on my phone via Safari to debug the Javascript. I've tried using both Safari and Safari Technology Preview, I've got the correct settings on both the phone and in the desktop browser. I'm running the latest iOS beta on my phone (16.5.x) and running Ventura 13.4 on the desktop. Sorry if this is a FAQ
