__@norman137__ says 
> It's cause they import from a private Cordova module which has changed in cordova ios 7. I've reported this to them back in April (when I was testing ios 7 prerelease): <https://github.com/kelvinhokk/cordova-plugin-localization-strings/issues/79>
> 
> I haven't made a PR yet cause I haven't gotten around to updating my apps to iOS 7 yet, but intend to do so, just can't guarantee when... (I have a huge backlog of issues and updating iOS platform is on a lower priority). The details in the issue should be sufficient enough to make a PR, or just to apply the change locally.

> I asked what is the intent of using the a private API so that I could push a public API route to do what they need to do so we can avoid breaking it in the future but no one really answered that question unfortunately.
