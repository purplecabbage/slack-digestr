__@alex678__ says 
> Hello everybody, thanks for the help last time to keep SQLite Android plugin working, i recompiled the .so libs of the "Legacy plugin", but for the "ext" and "storage" plugin, is not the same thing, there is one auto-build from Makefile + jni/Android.mk and <http://Application.mk|Application.mk>. I launched makefile but it generates smth like libsqlc-native-driver.so but we except to have libsqlc-*ndk*-native-driver.so  . Libs are also &lt;&gt;, some "Java_io_liteglue_SQLiteNDKNativeDriver" are missing in the recently compiled lib. Do you know if there is any missing flag/option to do ? Best regards.

__@alex678__ says 
> I changed LOCAL_MODULE := sqlc-native-driver --&gt; LOCAL_MODULE := sqlc-ndk-native-driver in <http://Android.mk|Android.mk>. Not sure is a good idea, but in .so i see that previously we had some &lt;&gt; about "NDK".
