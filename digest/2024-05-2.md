> 👋 Unfamiliar with Cordova but a client uses it and we're troubleshooting an issue with them currently -- so any help will be much 🙇‍♂️
> 
> We have a JS SDK that does a `window.open` with an external URL when a button is clicked. Doesn’t seem to work on Cordova. From searches, it seems like SO recommends installing <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cordova-docs/blob/master/articles/cordova-security/cordova-security-whitlists.md> and configuring it. I do see the config.xml file has the following:
> ``` &lt;access origin="*" /&gt;
>     &lt;allow-navigation href="*" /&gt;```
> Is anything more needed?

> That blog is old/out-dated, the whitelist plugin is no longer needed assuming you're running fairly recent version of cordova and its platforms. The whitelist (now called allow list) is built into the core platform.
> 
> As far as `window.open` usage, I'm not 100% sure, it's not something is commonly used since it will leave the app. The webview doesn't support "tabs" so to speak, so I believe `window.open` will effectively open the system default browser, if allowed.
> 
> `&lt;access&gt;` tags allows network request to the declared origins, this is for DOM XHR requests, `&lt;img&gt;` srcs, and other document assets. It's an old version of CSP basically.
> 
> `&lt;allow-navigation&gt;` allows the webview instance to load the provided URLs, so I don't think this is what you want either.
> 
> What I think you need is `&lt;allow-intent&gt;` which allows external URLs to be loaded:
> 
> ```Without any &lt;allow-intent&gt; tags, no requests to external URLs are allowed. However, the default Cordova application includes a quite liberal set of allow-intent entries by default. It is advised to narrow this down based on each app's needs.
> 
> On Android, this equates to sending an intent of type BROWSEABLE.
> 
> This allow list applies only to the main Cordova webview, and does not apply to any plugins, for example the InAppBrowser webview, or opening links in the system web browser. It is only aplied to hyperlinks and calls to window.open().
> 
> Note: allow-navigation takes precedence over allow-intent. Allowing navigation to all URLs with &lt;allow-navigation href="*" /&gt; for example has the side effect of "capturing" all intents, so the webview navigates to them instead of triggering e.g. external apps.```

__@norman137__ says 
> `allow-navigation` sounds like it would work, but might be less secure for what you need.

__@andrew124__ says 
> So, we have a web based application that is being opened up within an iframe in a client's cordova app. Within our web application, we have a button which links to an oauth site. After succesful oauth, the tab closes itself, but on ios simulator, we're seeing a blank screen. The tab has closed, but the in app browser seems to still be open with no way of navigating back to the app itself.
> 
> Any ideas on how to kill the in app browser if there are no more tabs? I can't actually edit the cordova code since I only have access to the web based app which is within an iframe of the cordova app
