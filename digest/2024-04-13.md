__@james__ says 
> Hello, I'm having real trouble trying to work out how to configure/customize the *splash screen* of my cordova Android app.
> I just want a basic, static splash screen for now. Perhaps just my app icon on a white background.
> The documentation says:
> ```Starting in Android 12, Google has implemented a new SplashScreen API to control the app launch animation which runs on a device with Android 12 and higher. For backwards compatibility, Cordova has included the core-splashscreen compatibility library which extends this features back to Android API 21 and higher.
> 
> To effectively create your own Android SplashScreen assets, it is important to understand the requirements of an Adaptive Icon.```
> and gives this example:
> ```<platform name="android">
>     <preference name="AndroidWindowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon" value="res/screen/android/splashscreen.xml" />
> </platform>```
> I have created an adaptive icon "res" folder in Android Studio but I still can't work out how that helps me.
> The Cordova docs also link to a <https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen#dimensions|section in the Android documentation> which explains how to integrate an Adobe After Effects animation into an Android app for the splash screen, and requires adding some Groovy/Kotlin code to the build.gradle file.
> It seems to be getting quite involved. Is there a simple solution that I am missing?
> I am using cordova-android v10. It looks like the cordova-plugin-splashscreen has disappeared from the list of plugins.
