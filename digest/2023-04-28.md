__@dpogue__ says 
> Is anyone familiar with Android FileProviders?
> There's a PR to improve file picking and media capture in cordova-android (which is a longstanding problem that I'd love to see fixed), but there are some questions about FileProviders and whether those should be included by default or added by the File plugin as-needed: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/1609/files#r1178382538>
>

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> In case we want to require a plugin for input file to work, it should probably be camera and not file since camera also has a provider and already has logic for the file picking 
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 19:03:41 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> But I think it would make sense to have the provider directly in cordova-android
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 19:03:59 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> So other plugins can use it instead of creating their own
>

__@dpogue__ says 
> My main concern is around potential security risks providing access to filesystem areas that shouldn't be accessible by default
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 20:48:49 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> You still need code for making them accessible, but still, the default provider paths should only allow the folder the input file needs, not all
>

> Caches dir in this case

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 20:54:26 GMT

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> But if Edit-config is as broken as norman says, then other plugins will need to have their own provider or write on caches too if they want to use the cordova-android one

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> Looks like a CORS problem
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:53:05 GMT

__@nathan.hostens__ says 
> My Django API does not receive the request at all (nothing is logged), and I have followed steps to allow CORS.
> In settings.py:
> `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True`
> The relevant package and middleware are installed too
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:55:39 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True` results with the server returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` as a header response using the wildcard, in my experience that doesn't work for iOS.
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:56:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> iOS doesn't honour the wildcard, at least back in iOS 9 or 10, I haven't really tested it since.
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:57:04 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> My server stack will read the request's `Origin` header and set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to achieve the same wildcard effect.
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:59:10 GMT

__@nathan.hostens__ says 
> Oh, I've read about that but I didn't think this code would result in a wildcard. I'm going to try and implement your solution, thank you.
> Do all devices have the same origin? I'd like to add mobile origins to a whitelist. Anyway, I'm going to have a look at this, thank you.

__@norman137__ says 
> your origin is based on your scheme settings

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:00:21 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you're using a filesystem-based (so your HTML document is laoded from `file://` then the origin will be `null`.
> 
> Otherwise it's your `&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;`, which for cordova apps, the default scheme if used is `<app://localhost>`
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:00:34 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Ionic implements it and their default is `<ionic://localhost>` I think
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:01:39 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Android will have a different default however, which is `<https://localhost>`. They unfortunately cannot be the same due to the underlying API restrictions where Android the scheme must be `http` or `https`, and iOS must be something that is not a well defined scheme, so iOS restricts using `http` or `https`.

__@norman137__ says 
> Also depending on how your endpoints/http methods being used, it could be triggering a preflight request. So if you have a `GET /example` endpoint, a preflight request will hit that endpoint with the `OPTIONS` method first, which should repond with the CORS configuration that the `GET` response will return (and the `OPTIONS` response should return no body or do no actual work other than resolving the CORS configuration)

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:22:48 GMT

__@nathan.hostens__ says 
> I must admit I am not so used to that vocabulary. But if it was a CORS problem, why would it work on my simulator ? And how would an app like API Tester be able to access the API?
> 

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:33:29 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Like I said in the thread, I don't necessary believe t's a CORS issue... cause a CORS issue doesn't typically produce a `TypeError`...
> 
> But I do think some kind of error is happening, and perhaps you have application code that is hiding the actual error.
> 
> ```{"transitional":{"silentJSONParsing":true,"forcedJSONParsing":true,```
> Kind of concerns with these ettings, if it's trying to forcefully parse a response as JSON when the response is not... JSON, then perhaps that's the source of that `TypeError`.

__@norman137__ says 
> I'd try using a raw `XMLHttpRequest` for now to remove anything that axios might be doing.

__@nathan.hostens__ says 
> Thank you for your thoughtful answers.

Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:57:45 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@nathan.hostens__ says
