__@daviesd__ says 
> Hi. Haven't been on here in ages.  I'm updating my iOS app for the first time in a year.  I wasn't able to connect to Webview with Safari anymore to debug.  I noticed cordova-ios 6.3.0 supposedly fixed this, but I still can't connect to the Webview using Safari for debugging.  Is there something else I need to do?

Fri, 28 Apr 2023 19:07:07 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if those are prebuilt libraries, they will need to be rebuilt with arm64 included. It was fairly common for builds targeting ios simulator to only include x86 architecture since before the M chips, the only possible architecture they could run on was x86, which naturally won't work without rosetta on Apple's M chips.
