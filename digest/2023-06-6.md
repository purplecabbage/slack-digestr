__@dpogue__ says 
> So in Xcode 15, CordovaLib.xcodeproj gives the following warning (not an error though):
> &gt; .../cordova-ios/CordovaLib/CordovaLib.xcodeproj The iOS deployment target 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET' is set to 11.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 12.0 to 17.0.99.

__@norman137__ says 
> I recall seeing that kind of messgae when I was testing against an older version of cordova-ios on xcode 14 and it prevented a build cause it had a min deployment target of 10.0 but the minimum xcode supported was 11.0

__@dpogue__ says

__@dpogue__ says 
> Was the outstanding question about whether iOS 12 would be supported? Because that seems to be the case

Mon, 05 Jun 2023 23:59:26 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 00:05:09 GMT

__@dpogue__ says

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 00:14:01 GMT

__@dpogue__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> unrelated but do you happen to know how to check a static library (an `.a` file) if it was built using an iphoneos sdk or the iphonesimulator sdk

__@dpogue__ says

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 01:34:03 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 01:36:38 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> i found `otool -l`, the `-L` just simply returns some symbols.

> `otool -l` prints a lot of information and supposedly there would be an `LC_VERSION_MIN-MACOS` for macos / ios simulator or `LC_VERSION_MIN_IOS` for iphoneos sdk

__@norman137__ says 
> im running into an error where its telling me im trying to link a binary built with iphoneos sdk into a product that is iphonesimulator, but everything else is saying that im building a iphonesimulator library, so im just trying to prove that my binary is in fact an iphoneos built library, argh ðŸ¤¯

__@dpogue__ says

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 01:39:16 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah i did try that

Tue, 06 Jun 2023 01:47:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> part of the problem is that these binaries are actually produced by cmake / makefiles .. so that we can have a single build system essentially for all targets, including iphone, android NDK, and our local machine as targets as well. So, starting to guess I have a misconfiguration somewhere in there

__@norman137__ says 
> not sure if it's documented but cordova will read `CORDOVA_JAVA_HOME` and set `JAVA_HOME` to it for its runtime process allowing you to configure a particular JDK install to use with cordova which often requires an older JDK due to android build system. And keep your system JDK separate

__@norman137__ says 
> Thankfully that may become a thing in the past with AGP 8, which we will probably see in cordova-android@13

Mon, 05 Jun 2023 22:50:36 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> AGP 8 supports (and requires) JDK 17 which is fairly modern, but yah for the time being setting `CORDOVA_JAVA_HOME` environment variable sounds like a potential solution for you

__@info460__ says
