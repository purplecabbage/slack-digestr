__@alex678__ says 
> Hello, for info. I tried to launch my current JellyFish + App without Concerned Lib. with the available 16Kb Emulator. Then, no error.  I also checked adb shell get config PAGE_SIZE and I have 16.
> 

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 11:04:02 GMT

__@alex678__ says 
> Then, i try with the App with the .SO Lib, then i have this error. so i think due to the "libsqlc-native-driver.so" (not compiled for pagesize16).

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 11:04:43 GMT

__@alex678__ says 
> But i dont see any log, except this error.  Do you know please where i can check to be sure that is related to the library ?

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 12:53:02 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Not sure. If I tried to run an older binary with the default page size, it would produce an error like:

> It would explicitly state the so file. But that could be because I was running Koala, not jellyfish

__@norman137__ says 
> theres also 2 different 16kb emulators

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 12:57:40 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> there is a "VanillaIceCream" version and there is an "API 35" version. I think the API 35 version is newer, so if you're using the VanillaIceCream preview version, you could try the Android API 35 variant instead.
> 
> They also have a "Pre-release" image now which is something new... when I was testing they only had the Google Play experimental 16k images.

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 13:08:55 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> I don't quite remember, on my M2 Mac (aka running arm64 host) both the vanilla ice cream and API 35 variants worked.
> 
> But on my linux workstation running x86_64 host, the vanila ice cream x86_64 emulator didn't work as expected if I recall correctly and maybe that's what you're experiencing.

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 13:19:06 GMT

__@alex678__ says 
> Ok thx so i will first try to remove the SQLite plugin then relaunch the emulator for the same app.

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:25:05 GMT

__@alex678__ says 
> For info, about emulators, i download Koala Beta + Emulator with "SDK 35 Page 16" and it's really in 4Kb (adb shell, getconfig PAGE_SIZE).    With Vanilla Page 16, here we have really 16.

__@norman137__ says

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:49:55 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:50:12 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:51:06 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> intel/x86 architecture has no support for 16k page sizes, so when running on x86 architecture it needs to be emulated which is probably why it's more flaky on x86 systems
> 

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:52:10 GMT

__@alex678__ says 
> "intel/x86 architecture has no support for 16k page sizes" ?   It means that even if adb show 16, that the emulator respond as 4 so my test could be wrong ?

Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:52:12 GMT

__@norman137__ says

> I followd your exemple, i did not "make init",  but i executed ndk-build.   Libs are created, 4 systems just armeabi is missing, i analysed the ELF files, there are some differences with your build (I used NDK 26.1) but i see 0x4000 😉      I will do some tests with the New Libs.
