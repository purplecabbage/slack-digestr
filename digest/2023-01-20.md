> Hello everybody, I am now in the point of optimizing my app and like to ask 2 questions.
> 1. What are the options of caching the resources inside of an app. Should I instruct browser caching or is this handled by Android OS?
> 2. In webdev world there are options of preloading the next page even before it's called by prefetch and/or preload. Is this also applicable inside of Cordova?
> Thank you for you time.
