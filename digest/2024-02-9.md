> Question about the Notifications Plugin..
> 
> Hey All! I've been away for a very long time... trying to get back into it but I'm finding myself to be lacking!
> 
> Anyway, the Katzer / cordova-plugin-local-notifications doesn't look like it gets much work so first off, does anyone know if it's still active or is there something later that I should focus on?
> 
> If this is still the best, does anyone know where all those properties are documented? The current readme just says not all properties are available on all platforms but it doesn't say which platforms for which and what the settings / parameters are for each property.
> 
> Suggestions?
