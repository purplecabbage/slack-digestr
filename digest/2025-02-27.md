__@bechard__ says 
> Hello, I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand why I'm not able to render files stored on disk on the latest cordova and files plugin?  My files are properly reading and writing internally in my cordova app, but I can't get any URLs to render, like images and videos.  It's like the CDV urls are just ignored?

> <https://localhost/__cdvfile_persistent__/media/video_file_a4bb08.mp4> is an example URL i get from .getUrl(), which the documentation says should be working, but it does not.

> This file does exist (was downloaded by the app) and I can see it on disk at /data/user/0/app_dir/files/files/<https://localhost/__cdvfile_persistent__/media/video_file_a4bb08.mp4|media/video_file_a4bb08.mp4>, and besides the URL comes from the fileEntry.getURL
