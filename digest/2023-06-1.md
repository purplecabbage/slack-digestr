> Hi community! IÂ´m trying to add a paypal subscription method to my cordova-electron app.  We already integrated on the React web app.  My idea is to open the user default web browser for make the payment from there.  I cannot find a way to do that. I tryied the inappbrowser plugin `window.cordova.InAppBrowser.open('<https://www.google.com>','_system','')`, but opens a new webview page. Anyone can help me? Or give me an idea how to approach this?
