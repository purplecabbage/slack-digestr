> I have created a PR on cordova-camera-plugin that contain the changes to remove the read and write media permissions and falls back to use the Android photo picker (based on the article shared in the plugin chat <https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/permissionless-is-the-future-of-storage-on-android-3fbceeb3d70a> ) to adhere to the Google policy requirements related to Permissions and API's access. Can the changes be reviewed and  this pull request can be merged as the deadline related to Google policies is not so far.
