> Hello.
> 
> We have a problem here.
> We tried to implement universal links. We use one signal and would like for the user to tap on the notification, and then get to the specific page on the app. It works well on Android no problem. We checked with Apple if there were problems with the AASA file, or if the problem was related to them or cordova.
> Problem with Apple is that it does open the app but doesn't redirect. it opened the app but sent me back to the web browser which then sent me on the right page. but when I tried to open the page on the app again, it send me to the app and then back to the browser again. for OneSignal, we at least managed to solve this back and forth by adding a line into the info.plist, so now only the app is open, but still doesn't take me back to the good page.
> Apple support told me it seemed that it was more a cordova issue than an apple one. has anyone had this problem before?
> here is my appDelegate file.
> Maybe that's where the problem is?

__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Using cordova-plugin on Android 11 for a device without an SD card in an app targeting SDK 33, a `FileError {code: 2}` when calling `getDirectory` for the following code:
> ```const dirName = 'documents'
> const filesystem = await promisify((window as any).requestFileSystem)((window as any).LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT, 0)
> const directory = await promisify(filesystem.root.getDirectory.bind(filesystem.root))(dirName, { create: false })```
> The same error also occurs for `{ create: true }` .
> config.xml contains:
> ```<preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />```
> The objective is to write any type of file (pdf, png, etc) to persistent storage that is not shared with any other app, does not sync to cloud, and is deleted when app is uninstalled.
> iOS works fine.
