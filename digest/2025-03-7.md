> Hi All! I'm getting back to an old app and I'm encountering something I thought we'd dealt with years ago... that white line at the bottom of the screen, exit the app and go right back in and the screen is drawn normally/correctly.  I've not changed any of the meta tags or config.xml settings. The project was built with cordova-ios@7.1.1 so what's changed? I did see the chrome notice that apple-mobile-web-app-capable had been deprecated in favor of mobile-web-app-capable but Safari didn't give that notice. (Obviously, I've fallen behind on something! LOL) Suggestions?
