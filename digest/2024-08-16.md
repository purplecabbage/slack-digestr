> ```MyProject has conflicting provisioning settings. MyProject is automatically signed for development, but a conflicting code signing identity iPhone Distribution has been manually specified. Set the code signing identity value to "Apple Development" in the build settings editor, or switch to manual signing in the Signing & Capabilities editor. (in target 'MyProject' from project 'MyProject')```
> That's the error. Which is a lot that I really don't understand. I'm fairly new to all this so forgive me flailing about please :)
> 
> So let's break it down.
> 1. `MyProject has conflicting provisioning settings.` â€“ What is a `provisioning setting` I don't have any file with that name, that phrase does appear in the cordova documentation anywhere, nor in the `cordova-ios` codebase anywhere. Complete mystery. I'll assume that's a red herring. Moving on...
> 2. `MyProject is automatically signed for development` â€“ that's nice but how did it end up that way, it's not something I asked for so presumably that's some sort of cordova or iOS default?
> 3. `but a conflicting code signing identity iPhone Distribution has been manually specified` â€“ How would it be manually specified when Cordova created the xcode project? I haven't edited the project (yet).
> 4. `Set the code signing identity value to "Apple Development" in the build settings editor` â€“ I have no idea how to do that. I'm getting the feeling that it's telling me I should be manually editing the xcode project; doesn't that kinda defeat the point of Cordova?
> 5. Even if I go into xcode and open the Build Settings editor... there's absolutely nothing in there that's labelled either `signing identity` nor `Apple Development` 
> This error message may as well have asked me to do the River Dance â€“ it would have been about as useful :D

__@noel__ says 
> Previously when I did manage to get a build to work after trying all day I think it was by luck. I basically just randomly opened xcode and clicked on stuff until it started working but I have no idea what made it work and it clearly didn't preserve whatever magical setting unblocked it when I persisted the files for posterity.

__@noel__ says 
> I think I found the magical setting again â€“ back in xcode, when I first open it and look at `Signing & Capabilities` there appear two Signing sections, one labelled `debug`  the other labelled `release`. I can see the error repeated in the `release` Signing section. I then unchecked `Automatically manage signing` and checked it again, then selected the correct team at which point the view reloaded, the two `Signing` sections vanished and were replaced by just one without either the labels, `Release` nor `Debug` and the error vanished.

> But the archive is coming out with `1.8.11 (1.8.11)` when the expectation is `1.8.11 (2)`? I'm pretty sure this worked in the past for me but it's suddenly doing something different.

__@dpogue__ says 
> Provisioning settings and code signing stuff are all in Xcode, yeah... I'd definitely recommend using Automatic Signing, but you might need to specify that via a build config json file. The current cordova-ios template includes some old defaults that try to set specific manual signing parameters. I'm cleaning those up in the next major version, but can't remove them from the current one because it's a breaking change.

__@norman137__ says 
> > Basically I dont know how to create the icon which use all the space to the edges.
> Short answer is you can't really. The other icons you see uses adaptive icons and a background asset which is basically just a plan color. You likely also want to use adaptive icons for more flexibility. You can use the asset you have now for the `src` as a fallback for older devices that doesn't support adaptive icons. But getting your icon to fill the space to the edge is going to be impossible since that area is dynamic and you don't know where that edge begins.
> 
> Adaptive icons are basically an image in 2 parts a foreground and a background. You can author these in PNGs still. The background, assuming that it's sized properly will the icon space but you don't know where the "edge" starts. This is because the end user can change the style of those icons to different shapes, so it can be square, or curved square, or fat curve circle, etc... Thus in your foreground you have a specific "safe area" where that area is guarenteed to be not clipped/masked.
> 
> <https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/icon_design_adaptive>
> 
> For adaptive icons both the foreground and background should be 108dp with 66dp square centered defined as the safe area for your foreground content.

__@info460__ says 
> Thank for reply. As I understand it now Icon Kitchon does not want us to step out of the safe zone, its just that its not consistem with their representation on the website. ALways something to learn. Have a good day
