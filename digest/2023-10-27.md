> Actually I think i see where it copies the image to the internal app's cache directory, but I think for video it just simply converts/returns the external storage url

__@norman137__ says 
> I fixed some random image picker plugin it needed `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` but it wasn't using any intent or the newer photo picker either, it was querying for the list of images itself so the permission makes sense in that context... since the app itself was implementing the actual picker UI via the plugin.

> Erisu made a PoC for the media capture plugin, you can read natively via the content url provided you get the input stream through the content resolver api without requiring any permission. You just get a temporary read grant for the files that the user picked (or in the media capture case, the file that was just recorded/captured)... But you can't take that content uri and convert it to a `file://` uri and use the file system apis to read that file without the appropriate `READ_MEDIA` permission granted. The temporary read grant lasts for the lifecycle of the app if I recall correctly.
