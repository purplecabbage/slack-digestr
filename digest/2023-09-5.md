> Hi eveyone!

> I created two plugin support for Android and iOS about Firebase and GoogleSignin with new SDK version. If plugins exists has problem, so let's try it. I don't sure old plugins can work or not working, But I used Facebook Connect plugin and it's not working for iOS and make a crash app. So I thought maybe it's time our need a some new plugin with new SDK for current and future.

__@erisu__ says 
> Java7 looks weird to me too. Not sure what that is about, but also the Android repo does mention `org.codehaus.groovy` as far as I am aware... It has to come form a plugin?

Mon, 04 Sep 2023 14:51:00 GMT

__@erisu__ says
