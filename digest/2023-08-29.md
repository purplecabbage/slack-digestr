__@spamact__ says 
> Hi everyone, Iâ€™m trying to get a definitive answer on somethingâ€¦ all the info online looks old (&gt;5 years). Is there a way to get Cordova to work with self-signed certificates? We have a customer who doesnâ€™t use externally-signed certs and needs to use our Cordova app within their own network. And if there is a way to do this, am I right that an app that uses self-signed certs wouldnâ€™t be allowed onto the Google Play store? Thanks!

> This isn't an area I have good expertise on, but if they are hitting a server that uses a self-signed certificate, I believe it will work for as long as the certificate is in their trusted certificate store, which is something that would have to be configured on the device manually.

> Cordova ignores SSL errors in debug mode to easily support development environments using self-signed certs, but will throw on SSL errors in release mode, but Cordova doesn't actually implement SSL validation itself, it's just responds to delegate methods. So if the self signed certificate is added as a trusted authority in the OS, then I believe those delegate methods won't be thrown.

__@norman137__ says 
> Using self-signed certiifcates only really makes sense if the app is only going to be used on corporate controlled devices, which sounds like is the case in your situation.

__@norman137__ says 
> As far as Google Play is concerned, they want you to use https where possible, and using self-signed certificates fulfils that requirement, even if the certificate can't be verified by a trusted root provider, as long as the device itself trusts it, then that's sufficient.
> 
> e.g. the app published on Google Play shouldn't ignore SSL issues like cordova debug builds does, but a trusted self-signed certificate shouldn't raise any SSL issues provided that the certificate hasn't expired.

> Obviously I cannot speak for Google but this is my interpretation of their policies.

__@info460__ says 
> Hello, one question about google play policy please.
> I got this email and one of my app was removed from Play store.
> The app have associated the same privacy policy page as others apps, which is accessible, so this should be not a problem (Its just simple game no permissions needed).
> I am little bit unsure about the: "Be linked on your app's store listing page in Play Console and within the app itself."
> 
> Does this mean that each app should have a link to privacy policy page from the app itself?
> 
> Thank you for your input
> 
> P.S. this is the link to the Privacy policy page (its generic and common to all my apps)
