> I have to write some E2E tests for my app using cordova-electron v3.1.0. How can I approach that? I was trying to configure it using playwright/spectron but both of them require the main.js file and I am not quite sure where to look for it (since the one in platforms/electron/www doesnt work). Is there a way to.. bundle it up somehow so it has the same structure as regular electron app?  Kinda new to the E2E alltogether and feeling lost, would appreciate some guidance! :)
