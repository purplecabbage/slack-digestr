__@porto__ says 
> hey guys, I've been using cordova for many years already (it's a ReactJS app).
> Recently we updated to cordova 12. We were also using yarn v1.2 and updated to v3.6.1.
> Turns out a lot of our users are complaining that the app is extremely slow. The videos they sent me are painful to watch...
> I can't reproduce as in my device it's really fast. The users are using the same version as me for both iOS and Android (OS version as well).
> Do you have any advice on how to investigate this kind of performance issues? Or any blog posts would be much appreciated. I've attached my package.json in case anyone is interested in taking a look.

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah we just tested it in our actual project which didn't reproduce reliability to begin with but it seems to work there too. The issue seems to be directly related to how fast the app actually loads... and our real app is rather heavy so it didn't reproduce all the time.
