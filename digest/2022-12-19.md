__@manuelbeck87__ says 
> Hello, I try to cleanup my config.xml. I moved the plugin cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr in the platform-tag for the iOS-platform. When I try after that to prepare my iOS project, the plugin is no longer available for that platform. Is it not possible to set platform specific plugins in the appropriate platform-tag?
