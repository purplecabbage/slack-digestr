__@xavier.serra__ says 
> I have tested plugin <https://github.com/guyromb/cordova-open-native-settings> in ios18 beta and it doesn't open any of the settings sections except APPLICATION DETAILS. I have investigated a little and it seems that apple has changed the deep linking urls that were used to open those settings sections. In previous versions, those urls were part of a non-documented api, however somehow they were disclosed. Any ideas on how to get them?
