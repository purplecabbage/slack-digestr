> Definitely required at minimum. `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` is also required if you want high accuracy gps reporting.

__@brando2147__ says 
> ahhh, kk ty, Looks like it might be for 34 at least.  <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?sjid=16564673367319673257-NA>

__@norman137__ says 
> Yah API 34 is still in beta `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION_PERMISSION` is only added in API 34 so attempting use it right now probably won't work without updated SDK.
> 
> It will probably require AGP 8 (Which requires JDK 17 &amp; Gradle 8 ), Compile SDK 34, and Build Tools 34, none of which Cordova uses right now.
> 
> AGP 8 has further breaking changes that affects cordova too.

__@norman137__ says 
> Also beta software isn't allowed on google play store, so even if Cordova did update to use API 34 SDK, you wouldn't be able to publish the app. The beta SDK is purely to test and prepare your app.

__@brando2147__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> If you deal with external storage stuff you'll likely run into problems

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:30:02 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Since android (yet again) changed how things work.

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:30:41 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> in API 33+ READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is now obsolete (although required if you tend to support any device less than API 33), and they introduced 3 new permissions to read images, audio and video.

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:31:20 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> yeah I remember you mentioned that, is it still only regarding files that are created by your app?
> 

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:33:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> external storage itself is a big... goose? show
> 
> But generally speaking if you only ever read and write to files that you have created, then you should be good. In which case I'd probably suggest you to use the external app data directory (or internal data directory) to avoid filename conflicts with other apps.

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:35:16 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If you need to read files created by other apps, then you need the appropriate READ permission, and it only suppots media files: images, audio and video. You cannot programmatically read documents through any file API on android.
> 
> Likewise, there is no write support through any file api on files that is not owned by the app.

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:35:50 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If you need to write to files owned by third-party apps, or read documents from third-party apps, then you need to use the MediaStore API, which Apache no has support/plugin for.
> 

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:36:12 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Also API 29 specifically has no File API support at all for external storage, MediaStore API is the only way to commnuicate with external storage on API 29 devices specifically. Ability to read media files through file api was only added in API 30.

__@brando2147__ says 
> Our app just needs to access the camera roll for images and attachments/docs, but doesnâ€™t create anything

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:37:20 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Then I think you're okay, but the apache camera plugin still needs a formal release, you may have to test with the master branch for the time being.

__@brando2147__ says 
> ohh, I think I did get it working last time around

__@brando2147__ says

Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:49:38 GMT

__@brando2147__ says

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> Notifications also need to request a permission, something to have in mind if your app includes local/push notifications

__@brando2147__ says

__@patrick662__ says 
> Looking for a suggestion to screenshot Google Maps in my app and put into an html element.  I've tried html2canvas but I get CORs errors.   Any suggestions on another way to do this?  It works fine if I screenshot other pages, but not the page with Google Maps embedded into it.
