__@jacobsgur__ says 
> On Cordova Android, `navigator.canShare` is undefined. And on iOS, is throws a TypeError when using a `file`. It works fine on Mac Safari and Chrome Android. Anyone else having issue with WebShare API with Cordova?

> For iOS, it probably expects a native `File` object. If you have cordova-plugin-file installed, it overrides the `File` object with a implementation that mimics the W3C spec, but it's technically a different object than the standard browser `File` object. I presume this may be cause of a `TypeError`. If you have the file plugin installed, you can probably test if it is the file plugin by using a test app without the file plugin installed and seeing if the feature will work in that kind of environment.
