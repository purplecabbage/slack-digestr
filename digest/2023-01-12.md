Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:20:55 GMT

__@brando2147__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@brando2147__ says

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:47:18 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah cordova doesn't like "upgrades". So generally speaking to upgrade you have to uninstall then install the new version.

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:54:41 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> For anything you're already using, the release notes is probably a good place to start. When you see a major release (5.x -&gt; 6.x for example), then you can expect some breaking changes. For the camera pluigin you can see that the requirements was changed to require at least cordova-android@10 for camera 6.0.0

> For anything new, if the docs doesn't explicitly mention what they support, then you'll need to look at their `plugin.xml` and look for the `&lt;engines&gt;`, for example this is cordova-plugin-camera's

__@norman137__ says 
> Of course if you attempt to install a plugin and you have a platform that doesn't support it or it doesn't satisfy the version requirements, you'll see a warning

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:00:20 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> So the most efficient way is to check each plugin release notes? I was hoping there was like a chart of version compatibility or something, but fair enough I was mainly asking because push notifications are broken in the my newest build  despite using the suggested plugin <https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push>

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:01:33 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Well, Apache  only maintains a small handful of plugins, everything else is third-party 😛

__@brando2147__ says

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:04:39 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:05:14 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> the push plugin is third-party, but most of their maintainers are part of the apache community so they probably follow the same or similar practices as the Apache plugins

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:14:06 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> generally when im updating plugins, which I try to keep them up to date, I run `npm outdated` which will tell me if there are newer versions available on any dependencies, including cordova plugins (as they are also distributed through NPM)
> 
> As long as it's doesn't cross to a new major version that what I'm using, I'll generally update them to the latest version available.
> 
> And if it is a major version update, then I look at the release notes if the plugin maintainers produces one. If they don't, then I see if they have some notes on the GitHub releases page as some people maintain their changelog/release notes there. And if they don't, well that's one of the things I look for when choosing a plugin and I try to stay away from plugins that doesn't at least maintain a changelog of some sort. Cause it makes me life harder when I don't know what has changed, especially when breaking changes are happening.

__@brando2147__ says 
> That makes a lot of sense, I was hoping to automate it to a certain degree and catch these things as I go but that makes sense, we generally don’t update unless something breaks which has been our inherited process

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:22:00 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> Usually its okay, but when something does change or we are forced to upgrade due to a requirement we spend hours trying to get the build to succeed and everything to work

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 21:22:25 GMT

__@thepsion5__ says 
> @brando2147 I've been dealing with something similar using Cordova with Ionic. I have push notifications working on Android OS API versions 28-32, but API version 33, for reasons I haven't been able to figure out, only asks for permission to send push notifications AFTER it receives the first one

__@thepsion5__ says

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:11:53 GMT

__@dpogue__ says 
> Android SDK 33 has a new permission for receiving push notifications that you need to request. If you don't request it ahead of time, it probably shows the prompt the first time a notification is sent

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:15:02 GMT

__@thepsion5__ says 
> That's kind of what I figured. But so far I haven't been able to figure out how to request said permission. At first I thought it would be this one, which I added to my `AndroidManifest.xml`:
> ```&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" /&gt;```
> However, so far that doesn't appear to be working.

__@dpogue__ says

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:32:02 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> @thepsion5 How did you get push notifications working with SDK 32? Did you have any issues? What are you using
> 

Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:45:25 GMT

__@thepsion5__ says 
> @brando2147 So, I'm using this plugin: <https://github.com/marutifh/cordova-plugin-fcm-with-dependecy-updated>
> 
> I ended up removing the plugin with the default version of the `ANDROID_FCM_VERSION`  and then adding it back with version `21.1.0`, along with some combination of removing and re-adding the Android platform and destroying and recreating the emulator. To get Android API version 33 working, I've also tried doing the same with `ANDROID_FCM_VERSION` set to `23.0.6` and that also seems to work, but I haven't tested that exhaustively yet.
> 
> I think for API version 33 I'm going to end up monkey-patching the plugin or switching to a different plugin entirely though, which I do not look forward to. In the plugin I'm using, the `requestPushPermission()` method returns early unless the platform is iOS (from `my-project-dir\plugins\cordova-plugin-fcm-with-dependecy-updated\src\www\FCMPlugin.ts` , lines 163-171:

__@gh__ says 
> That plugin is no longer being maintained by its developer. There are a number of choices - the most popular one for <https://volt.build/|VoltBuilder> users is <https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex|cordova-plugin-firebasex>. (We recently found it needed some updates for iOS 14 - the maintainer was quite helpful and updated the plugin)

__@jcesarmobile__ says 
> If you target sdk 32 and you create a notification channel the notification permission will be shown after the channel creation or next time the app is launched after the channel was created (depends on the device, you can’t control it)
> For requesting the permission I think you need to target sdk 33 (which cordova-android doesn’t officially support yet)
