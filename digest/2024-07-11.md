__@norman137__ says 
> Android 15 is introducing some major breaking changes, which primarily only applies to apps that directly or indirectly uses the NDK (e.g. if they import/use native compiled libraries). So this doesn't effect the cordova framework itself, but will effect any plugin that uses native libraries.

> <https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes>

> Notable examples of this that I can think of would be the google maps plugin, most sqlite plugins also include a compiled native sqlite library... might be others too.
> 
> Plugins that are purely java/kotlin isn't affected by the page size changes.

__@norman137__ says 
> if they include native libraries, then according to android docs they'll need to rebuild with R27 NDK (or R26 with some custom flags) to support 16kb page memory sizes. I'm still kinda learning the implications of doing that myself.

__@norman137__ says 
> no i dont think so. I think you need to use a 16kb image, which there is a simulator available for it.

> But im not 100% sure. I just know that there there is a 16kb image for simulators available. If you're installing the beta on a physical device idk if those betas will utilise the 16kb page sizes or if they will remain 4kb... I'm not sure if that is a software or hardware detail tbh.

> Hello, which plugins do you use for SQLite please ? I use cordova-sqlite-legacy-build-support and cordova-sqlite-ext but Breaking Changes are coming on Android 15 about Page Size 4K to 16K. So maybe at least one .so library to change/recompile.
