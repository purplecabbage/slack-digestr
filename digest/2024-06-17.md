__@alex678__ says 
> Hello, since i upload to last version of cordova and also cordova admob plugin i have some crashs but seems only on iOS 12 version, i target at minimum 12.0. Do you know if I must set to 13.0 or upper please ? (seems the admob plugin is not concerned). i see that on some forums but i dont know if we can do this with config.xml  The issue appears to be with linking. Adding -Wl,-ld_classic in OTHER_LDFLAGS in the target Build Settings is the fix.
