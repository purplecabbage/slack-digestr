__@rhinolance__ says 
> Intermittently, when running "cordova run android", after a successful build, it errors out with _`The "code" argument must be of type number`._  Unplugging and re-plugging in the device resolves it, but sometimes I need to wait 5 minutes before it will deploy successfully.  So far I've not been able to deduce the cause, and while I have a workaround, the extended wait at times is rather frustrating.  Has anyone else experienced this and determined the cause?

> There was a PR that I'm pretty sure got merged to address that bug so that the underlying error is displayed properly but I'm not sure if it made it in any releases yet. But that "The code argument must be of type number" error is not related to the underlying error which is hard to determine without attaching the nodeJS debugger to cordova.

__@rhinolance__ says 
> Thanks Norman.  Yep, I realised it's an error of an error type arrangement.  I'll install nightly and see how I get on.

__@rhinolance__ says 
> ðŸ˜„  Well I installed @nightly, but now I'm not getting any errors so I can't identify the underlying issue.  I'll see how I go over the rest of the afternoon as it's bound to pop up again soonish.    Or the latest version addresses the underlying issue too, in which case it's a win.
