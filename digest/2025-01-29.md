__@jacobsgur__ says 
> Has anyone used both Cordova and Capacitor, and has an argument for Cordova being preferable? I've been using Cordova/Phonegap in my app for 14 years. I'm very grateful to all the developers who worked on the open source project, which helped me build my business on it. I've taken a glance at Capacitor recently, and am noticing some important differences:
> 1. Bigger community and interest
> 2. Actively updated and developed Cordova plugins seem to be getting less and less over time, whereas Capacitor has a lot of recent activity.
> 3. Strong commercial backing of Capacitor, and more modern toolchain and API's.
> 4. It's argued that Capacitor's native assets are easier to maintain than Cordova's build tools and disposable native project assets.
> 5. Capacitor is supposed to be easier to add native code and even potentially gradually or partially use or transition to using Flutter or React Native.
> I'm sincerely trying to formulate an opinion around this, and am interested in other people's thoughts and experiences. Thanks!

__@dpogue__ says
