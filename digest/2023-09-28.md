__@norman137__ says 
> It looks like you're not using a fully qualified url when your trying to make the request to <https://domain/matomo.php|https://domain/matomo.php>
> 
> E.g. you're making a request to `/matomo.php` instead and standard browser behavior is to infer current origin as the end point when the host is omitted from the URL.

__@norman137__ says 
> `<app://mydomain.com>` would be the app scheme, which is something configurable inside `config.xml` via `scheme` and `hostname` preferences.
> 
> So if something is requesting `<app://mydomain.com/>...` instead of `<https://mydomain.com/>...` then it's likely because you are not using a fully qualified URL somewhere.
> 
> Like if you're doing `window.fetch("/myAPI")` that would hit `<app://mydomain.com/myAPI>`. If you want to hit a external server, it needs to be fully qualified: e.g.: `window.fetch("<https://mydomain.com/myAPI>")`
> 
> That applies for pretty much all networking parts in the browser/DOM, so if you have form actions, `XMLHttpRequest`, etc everything that needs to hit an external server instead of the cordova app itself needs to use a full URL path.
