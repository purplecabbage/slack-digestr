__@erisu__ says 
> Just throwing out ideas, but couldn't you use Cloudflare's Always Online service to cache a static version of your pages so when the server goes down it would then show the cached page?
> Would require I guess some infra changes... but, again, not sure if this would be valid option.. not sure what Google would see or say...

__@daviesd__ says 
> I had a plugin that WAS installing just fine a month or so ago.  Now it's complaining.  I'm using cordova 11.0.0, cordova-ios 7.0.0, cordova-android 12.0.0, and Xcode 14.3.1.  I don't *think* I upgraded anything (unless XCode updated).
