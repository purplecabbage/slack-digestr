> Hi! Is there a way to manually set the locale of a cordova app? As of right now, the defaultlocale in config.xml is “es” and when displaying input type date for instance… the input shows up in spanish even though the whole app is en english.

__@norman137__ says 
> i think you're looking for the `lang` attribute, you can hint to the webview what locale your app is in via the `lang` attribute. The default `lang` is "unknown", e.g. not defined and it's up to the implementors to choose what the default is, but usually it's the system preferred language.

> It can be set on the `html` tag I think so that the lang applies to the entire document, but it's an global attribute so it's a valid attribute to set on all tags, if you have parts of the UI in a different language for some reason for example.
