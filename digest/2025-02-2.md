> The docs makes it sound like its not possible.
> > Once you target SDK 35 or higher on a device running Android 15 or higher, your app is displayed edge-to-edge.
> > Important: Edge-to-edge is enforced on Android 15 (API level 35) and higher once your app targets SDK 35. If your app is not already edge-to-edge, portions of your app may be obscured and you must handle insets. Depending on the app, this work may or may not be significant.
> There was this method:
> > The <https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/activity/ComponentActivity#(androidx.activity.ComponentActivity).enableEdgeToEdge(androidx.activity.SystemBarStyle,androidx.activity.SystemBarStyle)
> > |enableEdgeToEdge()> function automatically declares that the app should be laid out edge-to-edge and adjusts the colors of the system bars.
> But it seems that it doesn't take any params.. at least boolean value to turn it off.
