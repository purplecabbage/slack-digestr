> Well since it's been a month, I went ahead and did a plain-vanilla test on my M1 machine. Same issue. Wrote it up here, since it seems to be more generic than my app: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-electron/issues/258>. I'm guessing something added for the 3.1.0 `cordova-electron` platform didn't address the earlier issue (this one: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-electron/issues/220>). That, or the goal posts moved for building with python on macOS. ðŸ˜•
