__@norman137__ says 
> I don't really understand the full context but `getAllCookies` API is asynchronous, so if you're loading an iframe just before `syncWKtoNSHTTPCookieStore` is called or something, it might not be "synced" cause you don't know when `getAllCookies` will call its callback, which could potentially be some time after the iframe made a request or loaded it's content.
> 
> Seems weird to call on async APIs that uses callback, but the api itself does not expose a callback parameter so whatever what is using `syncWKtoNSHTTPCookieStore` has no way to know when the actual work is done. That's a source of a race condition that you described:
> 
> &gt; If i have these calls in place then around ~70% of the time the cookies is available in the iframe.
> In otherwords if you make the function call "busier" it consumes slightly more time, which I assume delays when your other object actually tries to read the cookies allowing it (sometimes) to load when the cookies are stored/synced &amp; ready.
