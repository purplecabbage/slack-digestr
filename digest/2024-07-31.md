__@brett.blashko__ says 
> Hey, i'm looking for some support on a plugin not existing issue.
> 
> The error is:
> ```Module branch-cordova-sdk.Branch does not exist.```
> We've removed this plugin and all references (as far as I can tell). Our cordova setup is not a typical setup where we are running multiple Applications in one project, so the cordova cli commands are not applicable, and we need to add plugins manually.
> 
> We removed the `branch-cordova-sdk` plugin and replaced it with `appsflyer-cordova-plugin`  When we build the iOS .ipa, submit to the Appstore, and release to the public, some of our users hit that module does not exist error.
> 
> I've combed through the build artifacts (.xcarchive/.ipa) and I cannot find a reference to this plugin. I've tried to add a hack to just ignore that plugin but it seems like the iOS platform is using a reference to _old_ `cordova_plugin.js` and `cordova.js` files.
> 
> This only happens when updating from a previous app version to the new one. So if a user had 3.72.0 (uses branch plugin) and updated to 3.73.0 (branch removed and replaced by appsflyer) then they run into the module does not exist issue. Clean installs do not have this error.
> 
> Can anyone think of a reason why this could be happening? it's a hard blocking bug, where the users can't get into the Application due to that error being thrown.

__@norman137__ says 
> when you remove a plugin, it leaves behind some traces of the plugin being removed so the JS runtime still believes that plugin is installed, and especially if that plugin is an `onload` plugin, it will delay the deviceready and cause hanging.
> 
> if you remove another plugin, it will correct the state of the first plugin being removed (e.g. clean up the parts it missed the first time around) but the bug will be triggered on the second plugin being removed.
> 
> So removing and re-adding a plugin might also be a workaround.

__@norman137__ says 
> It does seems a pretty serious bug, probably something warrants fixing and making a patch release for, but I've been pretty wrapped with my day job activities. I haven't had a chance to investigate why it's doing what it's doing.

> &gt; When we build the iOS .ipa, submit to the Appstore, and release to the public, some of our users hit that module does not exist error.
> If it is cordova-lib#927, then this makes sense if the plugin is lazy-loaded (e.g. does not use `onload` true in its plugin.xml). This means the plugin won't be loaded until its called upon. So if the plugin is only used once the user does a certain action, then it would effect the users that did that specific action.
> 
> If the plugin is loaded on init via the `onload` flag, then it would affect all users and cause the app to never fire `deviceready`

__@brett.blashko__ says

> So the plugin that was removed is an `onload` plugin. So it must be affecting all users that updating to the new version with the plugin removed.

> If the plugin wasn't properly cleaned up, wouldn't the error show when I build locally aswell? It seems to _only_ happen when the .ipa is replaced on a users device from the appstore itself. I cannot reproduce it locally.
> 
> I tried putting in a hack into the `addEntry()` in `cordova.js` the hack just ignores the plugin with that name. When I force the error by removing the js wrapper, and add in the hack, the build succeeds locally, and I can confirm the module was skipped. I also confirmed that the new `.ipa`  has the hack in the cordova.js file. However, when the user downloads the new version from the store, the hack doesn't seem to exist. So it's like the .ipa isn't getting wholesale replaced. ðŸ¤”

> if it's the cordova-lib bug, then no it's not a build error, it's runtime error. Removing the plugin removes the native sources as expected, but does not remove the www sources or the json metadata that tells the cordova runtime that the plugin exists and how it maps to the native. Then it reaches to a `Class not found` error during runtime when it tries to initialise that plugin, which is missing the native sources.

> This is also not making much sense to me. I'm not as knowledgable with the iOS OS as I am with android, but I'm pretty sure they have a read-only asset directory that basically will be replaced with every app install/update, very much like android. This would be separate from the app data sandbox that apps writes to for persistent file storage.

> this is not consistent with that cordova-lib issue, you should be seeing a `Class not found` instead when it tries to find the native class during init. So I might have thrown a red herring (sorry)

> That's the part that is not making any sense. I can only reproduce it locally when a _force_ the `cordova_plugins.js` and the `ios.json` to load the module, but remove the `plugins/branch-cordova-plugin/www/branch.js`  file.

__@brett.blashko__ says

> Cordova v7.1.0

> We are not using the CLI. The projects structure was heavily modified years ago to support multiple titles, in 1 project. So we aren't using cordova-cli commands, and need to add/remove plugins, update cordova, etc manually.

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:22:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> ok, then that might explain the inconsistencies with the cordova-lib bug. If you're not using the CLI, you're not using cordova-lib which is a common set of tools to manage project files, among other things used by the CLI.

> Definitely weird. Naturally I'd say that the plugin wasn't completely removed... like something is left behind and it's tripping the cordova runtime to try to add the module. But it doesn't explain why it's not reproducible.

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:26:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:31:13 GMT

__@brett.blashko__ says 
> &gt; But I feel like the `config.xml` still has references to the JS modules
> the `config.xml` when pulled from the build artifacts don't include the reference to the plugin. Nor does the `www/cordova_plugins.js` have it either. I believe the `cordova_plugins.js` file is what loads the modules.

> There's absolutely no reference to the module in the .ipa files. ðŸ˜ž So that's why it's so weird.

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:33:26 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> ah yah i think you're right, `cordova_plugins.js` is normally generated. config.xml is probably used on the native side, but you're issue seems to be on the JS side.

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:46:53 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 30 Jul 2024 18:48:42 GMT

__@brett.blashko__ says 
> That preference doesn't exist in the `config.xml` so we wouldn't be using the WKURLSchemeTask. We are using `file://` protocol. I can find some references to it.

__@norman137__ says

I'm not sure how wkwebview behaves in terms of caching or if chatgpt is even accurate... Like I'm not finding any official sources stating that WKWebView will cache, or how it can even be configured.

> If caching was a problem, I feel like we (Apache) would see a lot more bug reports too. So I'm not entirely convinced it's a cache thing and I'm not sure how I can prove it or rule it out either.

> There's this plugin out there, however i don't think I can use a plugin since the files seem to be cached already, so new plugins won't get loaded. So I'm probably going to inject something at the start of the cordova boot in the iOS native code.
