__@senthilnathan__ says 
> i had a problem with this plugin, when i use it, even though there is a parameter to mention, what are the devices we are going to diagnoise, it will add all the libraries and in ios, you have to add permission for more devices, in android it would add permission itself. which we really dont use in our app.
