> I think there was a proposal to remove permissions from plugins and let users manage them as we do for usage descriptions on iOS, but didnâ€™t get any traction, so was not done

__@norman137__ says 
> tbh it might get more traction now... starting in august google says they are gunna start cracking down on apps requesting more permissions that is needed... so like the media-capture plugin for example i think requests all 3 READ_ permissions but if an app only handles images, then they don't need to declare or request the video or audio permission.

__@bigballi__ says 
> Trying to use cordova-plugin-googlemaps on a clean app targeting Android. Installation runs fine but when i run it i only see a blank view.
> HTML is only the div used as map holder. JS is only `map = plugin.google.maps.Map.getMap(mapDiv);`.
> API key is not the issue. no warning/error messages in logs.
> If i call map from the console it shows as intended with all it's properties.
> calls like `map.getMyLocation()` are pending promises never fulfilled or rejected. Seems like the js/native bridge is fialing silently.
> any thoughts?
