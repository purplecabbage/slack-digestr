__@octavianus__ says 
> hi everyone, I wanted to enable `SharedArrayBuffer` which requires cross origin isolation (<https://web.dev/cross-origin-isolation-guide/>).
> My first thought would be to add the necessary COOP and COEP headers via the URL scheme handler when request to main index.html is made.
> However, that doesn’t seem to work. When I inspect the network via Developer console in Safari, it doesn’t show any response headers for the main index.html document.
> Inspecting `crossOriginIsolated` in console also return `false` to me.
> Any idea on what else I should try or look at? Anyone has any success in enabling cross origin isolation?
