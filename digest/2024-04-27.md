> And that didn’t happen before? If it didn’t happen before it was most likely a bug, you should never manually edit the native cordova project files

__@xavier.serra__ says 
> I know it is not correct to edit those files, but what if we have other targets in our project such as Watches and we need to add pods for them?

__@norman137__ says

> Often the best path is 1) Build a plugin that does it, the `plugin.xml` api is similar to config.xml but has access to a few more directives like podspecs, and if that's still not enough, then 2) write a hook so that your native project manipulations are part of the cordova prepare task. e.g. doing the manipulations in a `after_prepare` script will allow you to further modify the native project after cordova has prepared/written the project files.

__@norman137__ says 
> the native project inside platforms/ are considered build artefacts so cordova may rewrite them when necessary, when it believes there's a change that is required. So using hooks can tap into that process so that your manipulations are done every time automatically and will allow you to update the platform without remembering how to make those modifications manually. Also makes your project more shareable among co-workers and such.
