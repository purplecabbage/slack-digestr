__@bigballi__ says 
> Something odd just started happening (was never an issue before) regarding my splashscreen on iOS.
> running 12.0.0 (cordova-lib@12.0.1) and cordova-ios 7.1.1
> Xcode 16 and iOS 18.0.1
> I'm using Default@2x~universal~anyany.png
> I don't want to generate a multiple versions for all screensize since it's a very basic image.
> The splashscreen no longer fills the screen from center as it used to.
> No matter the dimensions I use, it is simply drawn from top left corner (image larger than screen it bleeds, image smaller than screen it shows white background).
> 
> Also, I just noticed that although I have app icon files for every dimension, when I run cordova prepare/build/run, they all get replaced with the same 1024x1024 file.
> This results in the app having an empty icon.
> If i replace the icon files after cordova prepare/build/run, the icon shows as expected.

> For those that have problems with 16KB page size with plugin cordova-sqlite-storage, there is a repo from the same author that doesn't use any NDK and avoids this problem: <https://github.com/storesafe/cordova-sqlite-express-build-support>
