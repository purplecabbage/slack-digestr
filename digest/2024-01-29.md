> Hello!  I am trying to make a mobile app based on a website that makes azimuthal maps. I have some <https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf|ESRI shapefiles> that are basically binary files that I would like to bundle into the mobile app and load from Javascript like it loads other web files. For example:
> ```  let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
>   xhr.open('GET', src);
>   xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
>   xhr.onload = function() {
>     let d = new SHPParser().parse(xhr.response, src);
>     callback(d);
>   };
>   xhr.onerror = onerror;
>   xhr.send(null);```
> In this code `src` is one of the binary files that's part of a ESRI shapefile. The others are also loaded with a XMLHttpRequest. I tried adding the ESRI files to the img directory hoping they would be snarfed up, but it only took the svg. Is there some way to get cordova to include some extra binary files that will be loaded as demonstrated?
