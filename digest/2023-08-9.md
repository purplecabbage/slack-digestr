__@martin__ says 
> hello hello. Iâ€™m struggling with cordova android admob integration. Been battling it for some time. Anyone willing to help/debug for some cash? Iâ€™m pretty sure it must be something trivial, but I am just not a good android dev.

__@martin__ says 
> I want to register my WebView for Ads as stated here <https://developers.google.com/admob/android/webview>.
> so I added `cordova.system.library.21=com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:22.1.0` this line into `project.properties`  which then got added to dependencies in build.gradle `implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:22.1.0"` . I believe that should be it. but when I want to import this `import com.google.android.gms.ads.MobileAds;`  in a java file I got the following error.

__@norman137__ says 
> If you're authoring a plugin to interface, then you should just have a `&lt;framework&gt;` entry in your `plugin.xml`
> 
> ```&lt;framework src="com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:22.1.0" /&gt;```
> If you're hacking in the native library, then you'll should be modifying `platforms/android/app/build.gradle` and add in the `implementation` line inside the `dependencies {}` block.
> 
> I'd strongly recommend building a plugin wrapper though, as any manual changes in any files inside `platforms/` may be lost in certain circumstances, and it will make it difficult to upgrade the cordova-android platform.

__@martin__ says 
> Hey Norman, I am aware the changes I do might go away and I am not worried about it rn. I indeed edit the platforms/android/app/build.gradle. this is its content

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 16:55:05 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> If you're operating in Android Studio (which I'd recommend when working with native code), you'll need to run gradle sync to get IDE feedback/intellisense, and the build should find the symbols, assuming that the play-services-ads package is what actually provides `com.google.android.gms.ads.MobileAds`
> 
> I'm not familiar with the package myself, just speaking from general android development
> 
> If you're not working in AS but willing to start, just make sure you don't accept any update prompts, particularly to update the `Android Gradle Plugin` as updating it will likely break the project. It tends to include breaking changes to the gradle build system. So just dismiss any update prompts for `Android Gradle Plugin` or `AGP`.

__@martin__ says 
> oh right! I will try that sync. I am not working with AS, I just do `cordova build android`

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:02:52 GMT

__@martin__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:03:17 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you're not working in AS, then `cordova build android` shuld be sufficient. The Gradle sync is just to sync Android Studio with your gradle config

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:03:26 GMT

__@martin__ says 
> oh I see

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:03:27 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:03:59 GMT

__@norman137__ says

__@norman137__ says

__@martin__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:06:54 GMT

__@norman137__ says

> But that shouldn't be a end solution since once you migrate to a plugin setup, the plugin will effectively be part of the "app"

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:08:10 GMT

__@martin__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 17:11:19 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah, there are 2 modules, `CordovaLib` and `app`, where `app` is the project that cordova generates for you when you add the android platform.
> 
> Declared dependencies are only visible within the module they are defined in.
> 
> Alternatively there is a project-level build.gradle (platforms/android/build.gradle) and dependencies declared there will apply to all modules in the project.
> 
> But a long term solution would be to have a plugin import the dependency via `&lt;framework&gt;` directive, which adds the `implementation` line into the app module (plugins gets installed inside the plugin scope). If you need the webview instance, I think you can get it through `cordova` api.

__@martin__ says 
> Norman I gotta try my luck again, maybe youâ€™re still here and help me once again: I need to register cordovaâ€™s main webview like this
> ```MobileAds.registerWebView(webView);```
> I thought I am going to do it in `CordovaWebViewImpl.java` file in its init method using `engine.getView()`  but it throws an error that itâ€™s not a WebView but just an ordinary View.
> Iâ€™m going through all sorts od Cordova files SystemWebView, SystemWebViewEngine, SystemWebViewClient etc but canâ€™t find what I am looking for. Is it possible to get hold of the actual WebView? Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:38:23 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> one of them has a WebView but the returnt ype is `View` to support potentially different webviews (e.g. crosswalk webview back in the day)

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:43:26 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> The naming scheme is confusing bth, but the The `CordovaPlugin` will a member publicly accessible... `CordovaWebView webView`
> 
> That wil have a `View getView()` method which ultimately calls on `CordovaWebViewEngine.getView()`
> 
> Assuming you're not using any webview plugins, the returned object is a `SystemWebView`, which is an android's `WebView`.
> 
> If you just want to make it work for you and if you aren't using any webview plugins, then you should be able to cast the return to `WebVIew`

> ```WebView webview = (WebView) cordovaWebview.getView();```

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:44:43 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> you should be able to get access to that in your app's `MainActivity` class, which has a appView public member, which is the`CordovaWebView`

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:45:18 GMT

__@norman137__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:45:28 GMT

__@martin__ says

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:46:44 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you do it in MainActivity, you'll want to make sure to do it after `loadUrl` cause otherwise the webview might not be initialized.

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:53:27 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Normally `WebView webview = (WebView) appView.getView();` would be unsafe since you can't guarentee the returned object is actually a `WebView` but if you're controlling the project then you have a certain level of assumptions that can be made.

Tue, 08 Aug 2023 18:54:28 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> other webviews are not really existent as far as I am aware, like the crosswalk webview is obsolete for example. It's purpose was to bring chromium in android before Android SDK webview was chromium base.
