> Hi, I am facing a problem with cordova-ios 7.x.
> Could you please advise me?
> 
> The unlock method in cordova-plugin-screen-orientation is not working. When I call the unlock method and turn the device to landscape, it does not show landscape orientation. It works in cordova-ios 6.3.0.
> 
> The config.xml, package.json, index.html and index.js are as attached. Orientation in config.xml is set to portrait so that the splash screen is displayed in portrait orientation.
> 
> Note that if you add the following code to AppDelegate.m after cordova prepare, the unlock method will work correctly. This solution feels forced, so I would like to know if there is another way.

> ```-(UIInterfaceOrientationMask)application:(UIApplication *)application supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:(UIWindow *)window
> {
>     return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAll;
> }```
