__@norman137__ says 
> If you're on cordova-android@12.0.0 and aren't supplying a monochrome part of the adaptive icon (via the `monochrome` attribute on the `icon` directive), then there is a bug that makes it not use adaptive icons at all and it will fallback to the old `src` if one exists.

__@norman137__ says 
> if you're disabling auto hide so that you use `splashscreen.hide` API manually, which is kind of a common practice so you only hide once your view is ready to be shown... check to make sure it's actually reaching to that API call.
> 
> If it's only happening on some users in rare circumstances, you may have to look into crashlytics to keep track of those issues and hopefully gain insights when it does occur.
