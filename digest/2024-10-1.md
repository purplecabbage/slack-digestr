__@thorsten.wolf__ says 
> Here a summary i put together that might also help other people. TLDR: it now seems to make a difference which URL actually initiated a session in the inAppBrowser. Eventhough the visited page would perform redirect due to a SAML authentication flow it is important which url initially visited the webpage. So it makes a difference if i initiate an authentication flow by opening the inappbrowser with <http://login.microsoftonline.com|login.microsoftonline.com> or by <http://mydomain.com|mydomain.com> (that then performs a saml2 flow with redirect to <http://login.microsoftonline.com|login.microsoftonline.com>). What's interesting here is that in both cases the cookies are stored with the valid and corresponding domains. So just looking and the cookie stores it looks like the situation is exactly the same. however in the scenario where one would open <http://login.microsoftonline.com|login.microsoftonline.com> as a starting point in the inappbrowser and later used iframes with <http://mydomain.com|mydomain.com> would not be able to use the cookies, eventhough they are stored correctly in the cookie stores. If the inappbrowser would start the saml2 flow with <http://mydomain.com|mydomain.com> (and it appears to be exactly the same setup in the cookie stores) then an iframe within the main app view would be able to use the cookies. i also found a workaround that would make it work with the <http://login.microsoftonline.com|login.microsoftonline.com> start: After successful authentication one can open a "dummy" inappbrowser for <http://mydomain.com|mydomain.com>  (even with hidden=yes works) that would be authenticated (there is no issue in that way)  for half a second and then the inappbrowser also seems to make the cookies sync in a way that later iframes can use and access them. So all in all a very strange way the cookies are accessible within iframes eventhough they appear to be valid in the cookie stores. i attach you also some svg drawings showing the scenarios and problems in a more clean way ðŸ™‚

> in addition to that i think the webview now also defaults the sameSite attribute to "Lax" if it is not provided. But i still need to verify this. It might have been like this before. However we also needed to send sameSite="None" in the <http://mydomain.com|mydomain.com> to make it work.
