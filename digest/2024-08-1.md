> I have confirmed through my QA Engineer, that the user account that was stuck in this weird state, was able to get unstuck with the clearing of `WKWebsiteDataTypeDiskCache` , It's not a perfect implementation because it requires a second boot of the application, for the cache to be repopulated.

I was hoping someone could audit my code, and see if we can move it around elsewhere to make sure that the cache is flushed, and then reloaded, before the WkWebView is initialized.
