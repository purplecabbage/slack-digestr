__@norman137__ says 
> Idk, but CapacitorJS is a completely different framework so it's not really a direct solution. I'm not really familiar with it but it's similar to Cordova that it provides a native runtime to build hybrid apps (e.g. web app wrapped in a native shell). I think one of the main differences is Cordova tries to hide the native layer as much as possible, that the underlying native project is a build artefact whereas I think CapacitorJS treats the native project as part of the project, which allows you to do native things a bit easier than with Cordova. But I could be completely off base with that analysis.

> Generally speaking though, CapacitorJS most likely has a much more clean API compared to Cordova, or at least I would expect it to. Cordova is more than a decade old (14 years to be exact since the initial release) and with that it carries a lot of legacy code baggage that are generally left in-tact to avoid breaking third-party plugins.

__@brando2147__ says 
> Yeah that was very accurate to my impression of capacitor. We have been using cordova for years, I would like to stay with It I am just not seeing many solutions for getting the notifications to work right now.  It seems to be a common experience based on;

> From what I see it doesn’t look like anyone has them working reliably with SDK 32, and I don’t really know where to go from here as most everyone suggests the upgrade which I agree is a bigger commitment than I want right now. We are trying to get a new version in the app store as soon as possible and the capacitor upgrade will likely be very involved.

__@thepsion5__ says 
> @brando2147 Not with Android API 33, unfortunately. I've switched to a different project at the moment but I'm probably going to come back to this in the near future so I'll keep an eye on this channel and update you with anything I find

__@harel.mazor__ says 
> Capacitor lets you control the native part better than cordova, you can change the project properties straight in your project without a need to write a plugin, for example.
> Generally speaking, the solution is very similar but you control the code better (it's checked in to start with).
