__@norman137__ says 
> FWIW that PR appears to correct our issue. Although idk if not being able to specify specific resolutions is a deal breaker for others. For us (Total Pave Inc.) it's not, we'd prefer just to have a single source asset that gets scaled appropriately.

__@dpogue__ says 
> IMO it's partly a "if nothing in Cordova requires a higher version, why artificially restrict it?" but there's also some argument to be made that supporting older iOS versions potentially helps reduce waste by allowing apps to keep working on devices that are no longer able to receive the latest updates

__@bigballi__ says

__@dpogue__ says 
> Yeah, I'm not suggesting that apps built with Cordova should be forced to support any particular version, we should make it easy for them to set their minimum version as appropriate. But if it's low effort to keep compatibility within Cordova itself, I don't see a reason to bump just for the sake of bumping

__@norman137__ says 
> Keeping it at 11 effectively means that whenever we add something to the framework, we need to be mindful that it may run on something as old as iOS 11 and maybe have to keep if conditions or deprecated usages around.

> My initial thought on this topic was just to use xcode as a baseline, for example xcode 14.3 (and I think xcode 14.x in general) doesn't allow setting a target below 11. Presumably in the near future, in xcode 15 or something that absolute minimum might be bumped to 12 or whatever.

__@norman137__ says 
> Personally I'm more in favour of attempting to keep up with maintenance, because having fallbacks can make things more complicated to maintain, having to support multiple systems, etc... Idk how many of those "if" condition fallbacks are used in the cordova framework, there is probably more of that in the plugins themselves, but I'd the cordova framework + apache official plugins as all one unit, so if the cordova framework supports iOS 11, then all the Apache official plugins should also support iOS 11. We could have a different mantra, but it's my understanding that's what we always attempted in the past.

__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> Hello folks. Is there in cordova electron plugin system a way how to get a set of resources (e.g. cli application with bunch of dlls and other resource files) into electrons resource folder? I know it is possible from platform specification on project level but is there a way how to achieve it with a plugin? I know there is an asset tag in config xml, but it will result in having the files in asar file where it is not executable (i guess) and also the files should not be considered web so it should not belong to a www folder. And as we are redistributing some other application it should be distributed as standalone executable wihout further packing so it can be used with license like GPL2 without spoiling consumers application with the license.

__@miroslav.vojtus__ says 
> @erisu I guess you will know by heart. From code base I deduced that there is no such a way as the resource-file tag handling is not implemented. If there is not directly way to specify extraResources for electron from plugin is there a way how to hook to installation procedure and somehow get the files to the expected location from installer?
