> Hello everyone I need help with the status bar. It overlaps my navbar when I set `&lt;preference name="StatusBarOverlaysWebView" value="true" /&gt;` .                                                                                                            I have tried looking for solutions on GitHub and other sources but cant find the exact solution                                                                                                                                                                     Am using `"cordova-plugin-statusbar": "^4.0.0",`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1. In the first image *nooverlay.jpg I set* overlay the WebView to true and just set the color of the statusbar to match the navbar on my  android 10  but I want my statusbar to overlay the WebView.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. In the second  image *overlay.jpg I set overlay WebView to true and*  the color of the status bar to transparent `&lt;preference name="StatusBarOverlaysWebView" value="true" /&gt;`   and `&lt;preference name="StatusBarBackgroundColor" value="#00000000" /&gt;`  again on my android 10 phone as you can see the statusbar I now covering part of my navbar compared to the first image where I did not overlay the WebView.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3. When I used the same settings like in 2. above and tested on android 14 Pixel 6 the statusbar was just a black bar covering the top of the screen in the third image overlay_pixel_6. So in this case it never responded to the transparent settings but still overlapped my navbar.                                                                                                                                                                           Am using Framework 7 for my UI according to Framework 7, this should work well on IOS  but on android no some thing called safe areas when I inspect my .navbar-inner class for the navbar it seems the safe areas were added to pad the navbar                                                                                                                                                                                                                 `.navbar-inner {`
>     `position: absolute;`
>     `left: 0;`
>     `bottom: 0;`
>     `width: 100%;`
>     `height: 100%;`
>     `display: flex;`
>     `align-items: center;`
>     `box-sizing: border-box;`
>     `padding: var(--f7-safe-area-top) calc(var(--f7-navbar-inner-padding-right) + var(--f7-safe-area-right)) 0 calc(var(--f7-navbar-inner-padding-left) + var(--f7-safe-area-left));`
>     `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);`
>     `z-index: 10;`
> `}`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                So what should I do If there is a way to get the status bar height and add it as a padding-top inside the navbar inner class and remove the default padding using safeareas since they don't work. Or any other way please I would appreciate any help thanks in advance.
