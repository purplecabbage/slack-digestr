__@nimblejs__ says 
> Hi All! I'm glad I was able to find this Slack! When you search for Cordova development or npm plugins it seems like updates and user groups for mobile development is slow. I joined to ask if you see the Cordova user base growing? What could new mobile dev do to help? and specifically about admob-Cordova plugin. (Seems like all plugins are 2+ years old and not being updated.)  On a quick test, I was able to get bannerAds up, but not InterstitialAds.

> I've built a drag/drop UI for building webapps, and included Cordova/Volt Builder as a feature of the project. <https://www.nimble-ide.com> - So I'm looking for some guidance, group info and general information on Cordova roadmap. ðŸ™‚  Thanks in advance!
