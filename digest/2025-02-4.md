> I wish I had some better info - but recently hitting (what looks like) a CORS issue on both iOS and Android. Curious if anyone has experienced anything recently. This setup has worked fine and been stable for a few years. Suddenly `fetch()` requests from our JavaScript are failing with error - I never had the `scheme` or `hostname` preferences defined, so I've tried the following. And getting `Origin <app://localhost> is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin` error. Isn't the `*` sufficient?
