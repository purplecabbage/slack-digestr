> I've always kept separate package.json files for bundling web code, and for cordova. I'm working on merging them now, because that is the normal pattern. A problem I ran into is that my web package.json declares `"type": "module"` because it's all ESM code., but cordova doesn't seem to support that:
> ```[repositories/tc] $ cordova prepare
> Discovered platform "browser". Adding it to the project
> Using cordova-fetch for cordova-browser@^7.0.0
> Adding browser project...

> Failed to restore platform "browser". You might need to try adding it again. Error: Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /Users/jacob/repositories/tc/platforms/browser/cordova/Api.js from /Users/jacob/repositories/tc/node_modules/cordova-browser/bin/template/cordova/Api.js not supported.
> /Users/jacob/repositories/tc/platforms/browser/cordova/Api.js is treated as an ES module file as it is a .js file whose nearest parent package.json contains "type": "module" which declares all .js files in that package scope as ES modules.
> Instead rename /Users/jacob/repositories/tc/platforms/browser/cordova/Api.js to end in .cjs, change the requiring code to use dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules, or change "type": "module" to "type": "commonjs" in /Users/jacob/repositories/tc/package.json to treat all .js files as CommonJS (using .mjs for all ES modules instead).
