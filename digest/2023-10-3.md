> I'm getting a "failed to grow buffer" error during `[self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];`
> The size of the pluginResult is sadly a very large (about 120 MB)  JSON string since it contains base64 data.
> Is there any preference I can use so that the buffer error doesn't happen? or any other solution?
> the pluginResult is loaded properly into the pointer variable.. It's only when I call the sendPluginResult do I get this error message
