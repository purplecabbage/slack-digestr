__@brando2147__ says 
> I am running into an issue with cordova-android 12.0.1. I’m targeting SDK 33, When I run a release build  with --release --prod.  The resulting APK doesn’t launch on a device with android 10-11 It just shows a white screen. It does work with 12-13…  However the debug build is working without issue on 10-13.

__@norman137__ says 
> a white screen generally means you're hitting into a JS error... usually. Normally you can open up the web inspector to see  but on release builds the web inspector is disabled by default.
> 
> You can enable the web inspector though on cordova-android v12 by setting the `InspectableWebview` preference to `true`

__@norman137__ says 
> Then hopefully you can see the JS console while on release mode to see what might be happening.

> Just don't forget to remove the preference after you're done debugging

__@brando2147__ says 
> awesome thank you,  also I just ran logging when i ran the command and noticed something:

__@brando2147__ says 
> however, I think I removed that splash screen plugin when I upgraded

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:35:33 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah splsahscreens were implemented in the core platform v11 i think if i remember right. So the plugin is not necessary.

> The core platform version implements the android standard splashscreen stuff.

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:38:58 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> so if my splashscreen is working on android 12 it should work on android 11
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:41:30 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> it should, because cordova implements the android compat library which brings the android's splashscreen API to older devices.
> 
> But the branding image if I recall correctly is not implemented in the compatibility library, so the branding image will only be displayed on devices with native support. But the app icon should display on all devices.
> 
> There is a bug with the compatbility library however where sometimes the icon doesn't draw.

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:42:50 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> so the android compat library is included with 12.0.1 by default? I am not getting any errors in my chrome inspect either, according to the log output its using:

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:44:18 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> that looks right

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:45:08 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> and yes the compat library is included: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/rel/12.0.1/framework/build.gradle#L91>

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:45:38 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> is the `deviceready` event firing at all?

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:47:25 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> yes i do see that in logcat

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:49:22 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> when I analyze an APK build with cordova 12.0.1 vs 10.1.2 its generating a hash is that problematic
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:53:24 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> that looks weird, it should just be `cordova.js`
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:54:12 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> interesting, but it does work with android devices version 12-13

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:54:32 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> if you have something that adds that hash with links you may need to exclude cordova.js

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:54:52 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> maybe its ionic build scripts
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:56:25 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah idk about ionic...
> 
> But cordova.js is a file normally provided by the framework and is packaged behind the scenes. it's also specific for platform, so a iOS platofrm has a different different cordova.js implementation than the android platform for example
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 02:58:43 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> ah interesting,  I probably need to change my architect.build.configurations.production settings in angular.json then

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:07:05 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> thank you by the way, ill try it an report back

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:08:31 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> by chance have you heard of any verified solutions for: <https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/issues/260>

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:12:09 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> not really, and it's not something I reproduce in my apps either.
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:29:15 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> With our users its only android 13, and i can’t reproduce it either but we have users reporting it. Usually Samsung tablets, we are also having a ton of issues with background services with android 13
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:31:03 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> Our latest release seems to be problematic with 13 for some reason

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 03:55:22 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> i think i've seen the overlap with the status bar but not with the navigation bar.
> 
> If you're using the overlay, it's expected for the webview to be underneath the statusbar, but while in overlay mode the status bar suppose to be transparent, and I think sometimes that doesn't get set for whatever reason. I've observed that in my own apps.
> 
> But that ticket says it's occurring both on the status bar and the navigation bar so I'm not sure if it's the same issue
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:14:49 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> yeah thats what i observed it occurs on top and the bottom bar
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:15:05 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> I don’t know how to make it happen, but we have users reporting it
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:18:24 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> Also, we are telling our users to enable the gesture bar in android 13 as a workaround that seems to “resolve” it
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:30:02 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> One reason why I may not experience it really is we do have a plugin: <https://github.com/totalpaveinc/cordova-plugin-insets>
> 
> So we query the native environment for inset information which includes systembars, so if you have a virtual navigation bar that probably gives us the information to pad our content accordingly. Chrome's safe-area inset CSS stuff is broken on the android webview, has been for a very long time.

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:34:47 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> ohh interesting, well ty that gives me another thing to try. So I can’t replicate but I have a client who can so I have been waiting for them to test a build I gave them with StatusBarOverlaysWebView in the config.xml.  I will maybe try having them test with this plugin added
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:36:22 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> yah, the plugin just gives you the information, you can attach a listener so you can get updates on orientation changes or if the user changes the settings or something that causes the native bars to shift or something. It's up to you how you want to glue it.
> 
> One strategy is to take the information and make CSS variables so that you can utilise the inset information throughout your CSS.
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:39:51 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> Thats a good idea, and that will give me something to look into. It’s such a strange issue and has become a thorn in my side, I don’t think I have ever not been able to replicate a bug if a user reports it.
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:45:01 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> and I think i found a solution for my other issue but not sure the best strategy here, if I want to modify a method on the cordova.js file to prevent the hashing on the script tag. Can i do that with a hook if so which step of the process would that be, after_compile?
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:47:36 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> probably `after_prepare`
> 
> the prepare step if I recall correctly is when your web assets gets synced to the native project. So if you're looking to modify the `index.html` thats in your native project to remove the hash of the `cordova.js` file, probably best to be done on `after_prepare`
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:48:05 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> Shortly after that, a `build`/`compile` will occur which would be packaging those assets into your APK/bundle, so you'd want to manipulate them before that happens
> 

Sun, 10 Dec 2023 04:51:43 GMT

__@brando2147__ says 
> kk ill try that one, I think I can modify this method to prevent the issue caused by the build optimization:

>     var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script');
>     var term = '/cordova.js';
>     for (var n = scripts.length - 1; n &gt; -1; n--) {
>         var src = scripts[n].src.replace(/\?.*$/, ''); // Strip any query param (CB-6007).
>         if (src.indexOf(term) === (src.length - term.length)) {
>             path = src.substring(0, src.length - term.length) + '/';
>             break;
