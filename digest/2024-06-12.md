> I have detected a weird issue with cordova-android 13. When parsing hex colors from config.xml it adds a ff in front of them or if you set them in 8 digit format it removes the 0 in the beggining if present.

__@norman137__ says 
> If the preferences are being used as a color drawable resource, then `#034638` (RRGGBB) is the same as `#ff034638` (AARRGGBB) where FF in the AA position is 255, or fully opaque.

__@xavier.serra__ says

__@norman137__ says 
> are you building your own plugin? If so, perhaps a work around is to not include the `#` symbol... i already closed the project so didn't test this myself, but perhaps with no `#` it won't get parsed has a hex string and then you can get the value as authored. Once you fetch the string from preferences, then you can prefix it with `#` if you need to.

> Google doesn't maintain XML Pull Parser library but they do redistribute it as part of the android sdk. Even if it does get fixed upstream, it will be broken on all sdk versions up until google decides to update the XML Pull parser.

> I had a look through its <https://www.xmlpull.org/v1/doc/api/org/xmlpull/v1/XmlPullParser.html|docs> and saw no way to disable attribute parsing, it doesn't even mention it does any parsing, the fact that it does might be an unintended side effect itself in how it parses the the XML file itself.
