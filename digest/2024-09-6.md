> ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone! I am a developer for many years with love for the old-school core basics. Sorry no offence for all the frameworks but for front-end I like to hold on to plain html/javascript/css (hope everyone still loves me ðŸ˜‡). So I had to develop an app a few years ago and used Titanium. That doesn't exist anymore and now I need to rebuild the app. I chose Cordova and learned the basics and already have my app within a few days running in testflight ðŸŽ‰. Now my question: How are you dealing with the different iphone notches? I found the env and viewport settings that works for XR and newer... but now with the iphone 15 there is a new 'notch-obstacle'.
