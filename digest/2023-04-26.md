> I use node -v v16.13.2

> and all was ok, but when I updated to npm@7  (I reinstalled cordova@10 globally and etc of course, `npm cache clean --force` + checked with different plugins) but plugin fetch very very slowly,
> with npm8-9 the same, I tryed with next `spec="[my local path]"`  the same, they fetched but slowly,
> I checked all issues with npm 7 , cordova-fetch, and etc. and it is not related now, I used macos as build machine, not windows/linux

__@norman137__ says 
> Assuming you don't have a slow internet connection (installing a local file still hits the network for dependencies and such)

> The main difference between NPM 6 and NPM 7 I think is the change in package-locks and it being significantly more correct about the dependencies that it installs/syncs. In otherwords there was a lot of cases where NPM 6 won't install the correct dependency tree according to v1 of package-lock, leading to two machines potentially with different runtime code installed and difference in behaviour.

__@norman137__ says 
> Also if you're cleaning your cache often, then you can expect NPM to be slow, because that means you need to not only hit the network but to also download ad unpack a lot of files.

__@norman137__ says 
> FWIW, I generally use the latest or near latest versions of node and npm, i generally don't update NPM unless if I have a really good reason to, but I use whatever default NPM version that ships with a particular Node version.
