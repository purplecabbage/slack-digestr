__@rolinger1669__ says 
> Hello, I just upgraded my entire project from:
>      Xcode 15.4 ---&gt; 16.2
>      Cordova 11.1 ----&gt; 12.0.0
>      cordova-ios 6.2 ----&gt; 7.1.1
> 
> And now when I compile my app I get a blank screen on the simulator but in Safari Developer I am seeing tons of "*cross origin requests are only supported for http*" and "*XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///long-simulator-path.../myapp.app/www/templates/appPage1.html due to access checks*".
> 
> Everything was working cleanly before the upgrades...haven't seen a cross origin request error on local `file:///` pages before and can't seem to find related info to it through google searches.

__@rolinger1669__ says 
> the above cross-origin and XMLHttpRequest issues appear to be resolved, but now I am dealing with what appears to be $ionicPlatform.ready() firing before the plugins have actually loaded.  I am using both `cordova.plugins.thisPlugin` and `window.plugins.thatPlugin`in my deviceReady function and I am getting console errors like `Unhandled Promise Rejection: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: StatusBar` and `Undefined is not an object (evaluating `cordova.plugins.diagnostic.isLocationEnabled')`

__@rolinger1669__ says 
> I think my earlier assessment of $ionicPlatform.ready() firing before plugins fully loaded is incorrect.  I am running Safari debugger after the app loads in Xcode simulator.  There are no issues in xcode console OR when I load safari debugger, but then if I hit safari debugger "reload" - it reloads everything at once and I don't think its paying attention to the $ionicPlatform.ready() and its just trying to load all the JS causing various errors because things aren't loading/firing in proper order.

__@rolinger1669__ says

The actually template pages aren't loading into the DOM....at least not the initial one which is `tabs.html`

I have `cordova-plugin-statusbar 4.0.0` installed in my project, BUT...its not listed in the `cordova_plugins.js` file.  And, I have this in my $ionicPlatform.ready() but am not seeing it fire.  The `errMgmt` function logs init values AND outputs a console message.

__@erisu__ says 
> Should be able to confirm the plugin install without actually running an iOS build.

> For example, during a fresh install of the platforms and plugins, the following should be outputted to the terminal for each plugin and platform:
> 
> ```Discovered plugin "cordova-plugin-statusbar". Adding it to the project
> Installing "cordova-plugin-statusbar" for android
> Installing "cordova-plugin-statusbar" for ios```
> For the most part, this is all should be display... Depending on plugins they might output some more things during the install.
> 
> If there was an error that prevented the installation of a plugin, a warning would display.
> 
> For example
> ```Unmet project requirements for latest version of cordova-plugin-splashscreen:
>     cordova-android (13.0.0 in project, &gt;=3.6.0 &lt;11.0.0 required)```
> Ignore that the example above says `cordova-plugin-splashscreen`, it was just an example since I knew this plugin is no longer needed and would display something.
> 
> If there was an error, those plugins I would look into to see why it failed to install.
> 
> Next, we can also compare the plugin list in `package.json` and search in the `cordova_plugins.js` to see if all plugins are there.. any that are missing.
> 
> Note that not all plugins might provide iOS platform support so there could be some missing.. But those they are missing and you know should support iOS, then some reason they failed to install.

Mon, 06 Jan 2025 03:32:00 GMT

__@erisu__ says 
> Without further investigation inside Cordova CLI's process, I have a feel that the `plugin add` process only occurs when it was missing in the `plugins` dir.
> 
> The `plugins` directory is more like a staging area before its copied into each `platforms/&lt;PLATFORM&gt;` directory and adding its record to the `cordova_plugins.js` file.
> 
> Deleting only a single platform or all platforms and trying `cordova prepare` does not re-add plugins it seems. But if the `plugins` dir was removed, then it will re-add them to the platforms on `cordova prepare`

Mon, 06 Jan 2025 03:42:54 GMT

Mon, 06 Jan 2025 05:45:25 GMT

__@rolinger1669__ says 
> holy mackeral!!!! finally....go cordova.plugins.diagnostic to install and my app loaded.  Strange thing is when I did remove it and add it back in Xcode in the background popped up a message saying the loaded project had changed "keep whats loaded or reload from disk".   I saw that once, maybe twice before, during this whole process and each time I did select reload from disk....and this time it finally all worked.

> Usually I don't see this level of issues..
> I try to upgrade as soon as a new release is out. Could be slightly delayed if waiting on a plugin update to support a new version or I fork the plugins to make the necessary changes.
> 
> Also, how I usually upgrade is by:
> 1. Bump the `platform` with `npm` 's command. This will update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and the the checked out platform in `node_modules`
> 2. Deleting the `platforms` and `plugins` directory completely.
> 3. Run `cordova prepare` 
>     a. This will recreate the `platforms` and `plugins` directory.
> Usually I also have Xcode closed during this process so it wont try to use cached files in the running Xcode.
> 
> Lastly I also try to not define any of the plugins or platforms as a dependency in `config.xml` ... I keep everything in `package.json` .
> I know some people with older projects might still define these in `config.xml`
