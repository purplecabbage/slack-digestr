> Hi guys, we haven’t rebuilt our Cordova app in a while, but I just made a small change to it now and I see that some functionality doesn’t work. Displaying photos taken with the Camera plugin, displaying images obtained with the File Transfer plugin, and displaying videos recorded with the Media Capture plugin are now broken in our code. Each of these failed with “Not allowed to load local resource” errors, where the path started with `file:///`. My understanding is that WKWebView doesn’t allow the loading of local files, so this stuff probably broke when we moved from UIWebView and we didn’t notice. Anyway, for the first two issues, ChatGPT suggested as a work around to convert the file URI to a Blob URL and set the `<img>` `<src>` to the Blob URL, and this worked. However, for displaying videos — which can be large — it recommends installing the Ionic WKWebView plugin and converting file URLs to HTTP URLs by using `window.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc()`. I’m curious if this advice is correct, because it seems that Cordova and its more common plugins would just work and wouldn’t require Blob URL work arounds. I’ve been googling like crazy but am not finding much info on this, so I’d really appreciate any pointers or advice. Thank you!!

> If you use the latest (8.1.3) of the File plugin, calling `FileEntry.toURL()` should give you a working app-scheme URL for WKWebView: <https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2024/11/20/cordova-plugin-file-8.1.3.html>
