__@norman137__ says 
> sqlite uses tmp directories but fails to find the proper tmp directory on android (and presumably ios).. probably tries to use hte OS /tmp path, but for android that's not writable by apps. The native sqlite client prebuilt on android i guess uses a built that forces memory only, but we sometimes do large queries in which case it makes use of tmp files... so we've built a JNI method to instruct the SQLite C runtime where the temp directory should be, which needs to happen preferably on startup, definitely before any DBs are actually opened.
