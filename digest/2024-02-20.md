> This might be better in the cordova-electron channel.  To answer your question... and let me say I have no idea if this will work on electron or not... I wrote a pretty simple console.log() hijacker a long, long, long time ago. I uploaded it to github last year or the year before. You might have to make some changes for your needs.
