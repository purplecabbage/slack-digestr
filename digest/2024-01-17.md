> My app uses cordova-plugin-geolocation. There are some some Android users who are reporting the location is not correct. For example, sometime is ~300 meters wrong. It's usually when inside a building. I would think perhaps it's an accuracy issue due to being inside. However, those users get the exact correct location when using other apps on their phone such as Google Maps and even 3rd party apps such as the app "My GPS Location: Realtime GPS". Their settings allows exact location for my app. Has anybody experienced this? Is it a limitation of navigator,geolocation? Could their phone be caching per-app location to feign consistency? I haven't yet asked them to delete and reinstall the app in case it might help with caching.
