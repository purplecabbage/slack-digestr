> This probably comes a few years too late to be really useful to people, but I finally got approval to open-source the bash scripts that I've used for several years to generate all the mobile app icons for my Cordova and Capacitor apps from SVG: <https://github.com/AyogoHealth/icon-tools>

__@spamact__ says 
> Hey everyone, is there a Cordova or plugin API to detect if a device has a camera? We have some customers with Android-based barcode scanners. Some of them have hardware scanners (the kind that shoots out a red light like a supermarket scanner) but no actual cameras, and some just have cameras. My app needs to scan a barcode using whichever hardware is present. If it’s a hardware scanner, the user would press a physical button and the scanner driver would “type” the scanned data into a field on-screen, and my code doesn’t need to do anything special. But if it’s a camera, I’ll need to use a barcode reading plugin. I’m having trouble finding a way at runtime to detect which type is present. Any ideas? Thanks!
