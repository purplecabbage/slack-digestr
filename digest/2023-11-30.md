> Hi everyone, hope you all fine.
> I have a question about the CORS. Recently one of my apps, which is taking some data from a nother website (yes scrapping data) stop working due CORS policies.
> I like to ask if there is a way that Cordova app behave as ordinary browser access (to avoid CORS) or there is no way I can do something about it from my side?
> Thank you for your time
