> Just wanted to note that you’re asking over the holidays in many countries, so lots of us are likely not paying that much attention to Slack. And in no way Apache promises anything, as projects are completely volunteer driven. Demanding anything from volunteers is not going to get you very far in what you want. Apache software is offered on an “as is” basis without any kind of warranty expressed or implied as per the Apache 2.0 license. You may want to review the license: <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>

> To answer your question though, it looks like you’re attempting to <http://10.0.2.2>. On android emulators, this ip will be the VM host, e.g. your development machine running the android simulator. I’m making an assumption that this machine is indeed running a webserver on port 80. I’m pretty sure this virtual network only exists on simulators and will not work on physical/retail devices.

> Nowadays, all android devices that Cordova supports by default will block plaintext traffic. I see that you’ve added the `domain-config` but the problem here is that belongs to an android resource file. Cordova doesn’t support adjusting the network policy out of the box, but it is possible via `<edit-config>` / `<resource-file>` directives. Placing it in `config.xml` will not do what you want.
> 
> You can use `<resource-file>`[1] to supply a new XML resource: `<resource-file src="network_policy.xml" target="res/xml/network_policy.xml" />`. Note that the xml *MUST* be inside the XML resource directory.
> Then we will need to edit the android manifest to declare to use that network policy using the `<edit-config>`[2] directive:
> 
> ```xml
> <edit-config file="AndroidManifest.xml" target="/manifest/application" mode="merge">
>     <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_policy" />
> </edit-config>```
> Both the `resource-file` and `edit-config>` directives should be inside a `<platform name="android">` body. You’ll also need to add the XML namespace to use the `android:` attribute. A more complete config.xml may look something like:
> 
> ```xml
> <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
> <widget id="..." version="... xmlns="<http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets>" xmlns:cdv="<http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0>" xmlns:android="<http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android>">
>     ...
>     <platform name="android">
>         <resource-file src="network_policy.xml" target="res/xml/network_policy.xml" />
>         <edit-config file="AndroidManifest.xml" target="/manifest/application" mode="merge">
>             <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_policy" />
>          </edit-config>
>     </platform>
> </widget>```
> Lastly your `network_policy.xml` should look like:
> 
> ```xml
> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
> <network-security-config>
>     <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
>         <domain includeSubdomains="true">10.0.2.2</domain>
>     </domain-config>
> </network-security-config>```
> I’m not sure if using an IP inside a domain is valid, you may have to refer to the android docs if it doesn’t accept an IP[3]
> 
> The examples is not tested, but the idea should get you close enough. This will allow android network stack to allow a plaintext connection for your application.
> 
> Note that the webview has additional security mechanisms, CSP and CORS. CSP is configured via the `<meta` tag in your index.html document. See <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/12.x/guide/appdev/allowlist/index.html#content-security-policy-csp> for more details on CSP. It may need to be tweaked to allow 10.0.2.2. You’ll usually get an explicit “Content Security Policy” error if CSP is blocking something.
> 
> Webviews are also subjected to the CORS policy, which is configured server side. Depending on what your application is doing you may get an “Security Error 0.” or “Access-Control” error. In which case you’ll need to configure your webserver to allow your app’s origin (or to accept the any `*` wildcard, which will be necessary if you plan to support android and iOS). I have a blog post that gets into CORS in more detail if you need it: <https://breautek.com/articles/enabling-cors.html> It’s primarily written for iOS / WKWebView but the concepts are exactly the same for android webviews.
