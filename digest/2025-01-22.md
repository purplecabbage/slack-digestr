> *Hello* 
> I am new to Cordova-based app development.
> I have a requirement where the Cordova-based hybrid native application (*Cordova Native App + Angular*) needs to load a remote web app inside it.
> Does anyone have documentation or guidance on how to achieve this?

__@norman137__ says 
> Use the in-app browser plugin to load in remote content safely. The remote web app cannot make use of cordova plugins or other native device APIs outside of what is standardly available in webviews/browsers.
> 
> Both Apple and Google can consider remote web applications accessing the native device APIs as a RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability and itâ€™s against their app store policies to host apps that contains that ability. So code that uses native device APIs must be bundled within the app binary.

> There's still stuff to figure out and documentation to write, but this PR should be good for people to test and review and flag any issues or concerns they see.
