__@norman137__ says 
> If you’re app is larger and more complex, includes native binaries, you’ll see actual bundle size differences because it can strip out everything that isn’t for the target device.
> 
> For example native binaries must (or should) include 4 versions of their binaries, one for arm64, armv7a, x86, and x86_64. When you’re installing on an arm64 device, then it can strip out the other 3 architectures.
