__@matt509__ says 
> It seems that apps are still allowed in the stores that use cordova.  Cordova is the one framework I am able to have code that can move from nodejs, to browser, to embedded app.

__@matt509__ says 
> I was very disappointed in Microsoft (yet again) when they dropped JS project support is Visual Studio and dropped the WinJS library.  I really liked using WinJS and that is another example of why I don't jump on the javascript library/framework bandwagon every time a new "gee-wiz" one comes out.  Its just a matter of time before it gets dropped and leaves their client's hanging.

> Intune makes it seem that they support Cordova but I can't find any trace that they do. The repo also seems to be deleted: <https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/cordova-plugin-ms-intune-mam>. Anyone have any experience implementing Intune MAM?

> If they have android/ios sdk, then a cordova plugin can be created to interface with it.

__@matt509__ says 
> The great thing about Cordova is how easy it is to build plugins which map into native environment.  I try to avoid that at all costs, but it can happen.

__@lkvh__ says 
> I also try to avoid creating/editing plug-ins but it's weird that they advertise compatibility (<https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/ms-intune-app-sdk-ios/issues/21#issuecomment-506742714>) yet I can't find anything

__@norman137__ says 
> I wouldn't really call that an advertisement. That is a comment from 2019 so it's likely dated. No wheres in their current docs I see support for Cordova.

> Maybe there's a community/third-party plugin that already interfaces with their SDK, but I don't see any evidence that Microsoft themselves maintains a Cordova Plugin for intune. With that being said, Cordova plugins is just a way to bridge JS API calls into native, allowing you to still take advantage of using a webview for your app/ui and still make use of native APIs where necessary.

__@matt509__ says 
> I am going to rewrite that based on how things stand today, which would still be cordova positive.  I have such a big win from code reuse in these cases that it simply cannot be overlooked.  Mobile devices are much faster than they were 8 years ago.

__@matt509__ says 
> There are several ways to use Cordova in mobile app, some being more integrated into the OS experience than others.

__@dpogue__ says 
> yeah, there are also more options for different scenarios these days... if you're wanting to do something purely web, PWAs have a lot of features (push notifications, background sync, etc.) that previously required plugins... if you want to do a lot of platform-specific integration, Capacitor gives you more control over the native platform project files

__@matt509__ says 
> I use cordova such that I take over the IOS, Android and windows platforms and make custom code changes within the context of those projects.  This does make upgrading version of cordova a bit more difficult but gives me full control.  I can build a mixture of webviews and native views for the overall functionality.

__@matt509__ says 
> I mean just having cordova manage those native platform projects and dev only focuses on web code, versus taking over the projects generated by cordova and customizing it along the way.
> 

Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:39:55 GMT

__@norman137__ says 
> That's a practice I generally discourage cause Cordova treats the platforms/ as a build artefact and it may decide to rewrite it or whatever, potentially destroying custom changes. It also makes upgrading the platform version difficult like you said.

__@matt509__ says 
> For some projects I do just keep it to JS and cordova and don't need to customize.  For more complex work it can be helpful though I guess most of that could be done via plugins and JS abstractions.
