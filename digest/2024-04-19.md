__@eugene.trusevich__ says 
> Hi there! I’m facing a recurring issue with a feature in Cordova. Here’s what’s happening: When a pod installs for the first time, it defaults to iOS 11, as set in the Cordova-ios Podfile template. If the pod library requires a minimum iOS version of 12 or higher, the installation fails immediately due to this version mismatch. Even setting the `<preference name="deployment-target" value="13.0" />` in the config doesn’t resolve this issue because the Podfile only updates to reflect this preference after the first prepare hook runs successfully. How can we ensure that the Podfile updates to the correct iOS version before the initial pod install to prevent these errors?
> I see only 1 way it is create a fork from cordova-ios and change manually default version to 13 for example

> If you have `&lt;preference name="deployment-target" value="13.0" /&gt;` set in config.xml before you add the iOS platform, it should create the Podfile with a default of 13.0
