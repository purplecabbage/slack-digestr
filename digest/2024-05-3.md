__@christopher.gabriel__ says 
> Hello, I hope to find somebody who can help with this issue, I'm not into iOS at all ðŸ™‚ I've a small cordova app which opens, as main content, a public url (ex. <https://example.com>). Based on the UserAgent, <http://example.com|example.com> tries to load "<app://localhost/cordova.js>" ( or "<https://localhost/cordova.js>" on Android, which works fine). I get the error "The Page at <https://example.com/> was not allowed to run insecure content from <app://localhost/cordova.js>". I've added app:, <app://localhost> and all variants to the CSP, nothing has changed. The app is not using the ionic webview, FYI (I've tried it too, using the MixedContentAllowed stuff, no positive result). Any hints? Unfortunately, for the moment, I can't move the app itself into the device. Thank you!
