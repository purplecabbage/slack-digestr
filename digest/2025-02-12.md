> Hello guys! I'm having a problem. I don't know if it's an issue. Maybe you can enlight me on this one.
> I have a custom plugin which has an "after_platform_add" hook. For some reason when I add the platform "ios" it works ok, but when I use a recently cloned ios engine (I forked it from cordova-ios) and I use the command "cordova platform add --link ../path/to/cordova-ios" it doesn't work. The hook isn't executed.
