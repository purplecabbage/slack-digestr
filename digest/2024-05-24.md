> You're saying internal storage but your example shows using external storage. Android's terminology can be confusing but android's filesystem has 2 main partitions/storage mediums, "internal" and "external". External storage may not actually be external, and in fact on my devices is on the same disk as the internal storage. Devices with no SD card tends to do this. So external storage might be physical removable media, but it could also be embedded disk as well. Regardless there are restrictions on using external storage over internal storage.
> 
> &gt; window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(cordova.file.externalRootDirectory, function (fileSystem) {
> Interaction with external storage (e.g. all of the `external*` constants) vary in behaviour depending on the API level of the device. On devices with scoped storage (e.g. API 29+) I don't think `externalRootDirectory` is a writable path anymore. You need to use one of the pre-existing sub directories. e.g. `cordova.file.externalRootDirectory + '/Videos'`.
> 
> If you're building a plugin and intend to primarily work with the external file system, then I would strongly encourage you use MediaStore APIs instead of File APIs instead (which means you wouldn't be using externalRootDirectory or any other local file paths). File APIs has a ton of restrictions on modern devices. Additionally the File API on API 29 specifically has absolutely no support for external filesystem outside of app-specific directories. Android has a "FUSE" filesystem concept that maps filesystem APIs to MediaStore APIs with limitations which was only implemented in API 30.
> 
> Android is pushing native developers to use the Media Store APIs over Filesystem APIs for managing user media content. Filesystem APIs should really only be used for managing files within the app's internal data folder.

__@norman137__ says 
> `cordova.file.dataDirectory` is a good constant to use for internal storage for your app. It will point to `/data/data/&lt;app-id&gt;/files/` (some devices displays this path as `/data/user/0/&lt;app-id&gt;/files/`)
> 
> &gt; Download failed:  Unsupported path /storage/emulated/0/Big_Back_Bunny.mp4.1716470838378
> This path still shows an external directry, `externalRootDirectory` maps to `/storage/emulated/0/` when there is no physical/removable disk present. Which suggest that you're not actually running your app with `cordova.file.dataDirectory` change

> It's subject to the individual's volunteer time that they have available. Typically the person who started the release process is responsible for finalising it. This is precisely why I don't ever give concrete release times. The person making the release is generally very active behind the scenes, I wouldn't considered the release stalled right now, probably just life got in the way.

> Hello team, can anyone help me on how to get users to rate your app without leaving the app. I've used the *cordova-launch-review* on a phone running *android 14* but calling .*rating* method doesn't open up the rating window and no error is thrown.
> Please you if have any idea on how to resolve this, kindly let me know or if there's another plugin to achieve me, let me know
