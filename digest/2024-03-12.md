__@eugene.trusevich__ says 
> Hi guys,
> How can we build a Cordova iOS application through the command line (on CI, not a manual build through Xcode) after adding a .appex, if it needs its own certificate selected? The application builds successfully with the config from <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/12.x/guide/platforms/ios/index.html#using-buildjson>, but how do we add a signature for the appex?

> .appex being an app extension? If you have a plugin that manages that extension, maybe, but otherwise it's probably going to be an uphill battle of hacking things together with hooks

__@norman137__ says 
> I've managed a custom app extension target via a prepare hook using <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xcode|xcode> package to manipulate the xcode project.
> 
> But the xcode package isn't really documented so it takes quite a bit of work to reverse engineer the data structures and figure out how to use the APIs with the datasets, etc.

> And I don't have access to that project anymore to pull example snippets from.

__@eugene.trusevich__ says 
> No problem to add any extension, how build it is only from command line. Looks like 2 good ways:
> 1. Switch Cordova compile command to fastlane
> 2. Build appex new target via fastlane and do Cordova compile
