> About 7 years ago (back in the jquery.mobile days), I wrote some javascript that takes over the console.log, console.warn and console.error functions and outputs the logging to a div within a page in your app. This allows you to do some debugging out in the wild (or without plugging a device into a computer - which is really useful for those who donâ€™t have a mac).

__@norman137__ says 
> `EACCES` means you lack the filesystem permission to read/write/do whatever action that NPM is trying to do

> First thing I'd do is confirm that you "own" the directory.

> `ls -al /Users/alex/node_modules/bplist-creator` will list the ownership of file. I'm not on a mac so the output might be slightly different, but it should be fairly close:

> ```ls -al

> -rw-rw-r--   1 norman norman    545 Mar 17 16:52 CHANGELOG.md```
> The `norman norman` means the files is owned by the user `norman` and group `norman` in my example.
> 
> I suspect that you ran NPM as root at some point probably via `sudo`, which would have changed the ownership of the files to root. If the files are owned by root (I think Mac uses user `root` and group `staff`), then you'll need to be root to manage your node modules and potentially root to execute any node programs, which is not recommended.
> 
> If `ls -al` shows that the files are owned by root, you can change it back using the command: `sudo chown -R alex:alex /Users/alex/node_modules`
> 
> `chown` command is used to change the ownership of the file/directory. `-R` is the recursive flag, so it will change the directory + any sub directories and files. `alex:alex` is `&lt;USER&gt;:&lt;GROUP&gt;`, so you're changing the ownership to user `alex` &amp; group `alex`. I'm assuming the username is `alex` because of the filepath `/Users/alex`. Lastly we are targeting the `/Users/alex/node_modules` directory to change the ownership.

__@norman137__ says 
> Take care when executing the command, you don't want to accidentally change the ownership recursively on `/` or `/Users` for example, that could break your system entirely.
