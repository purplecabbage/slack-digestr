__@norman137__ says 
> Hi all... I'm experimenting with different authoring strategies when building plugins, and I'm building an Android Library binary (AAR flies) to be included with a cordova plugin.
> 
> If I use `&lt;lib-file src="dist/plugin.aar" /&gt;` directive, the file gets copied to the apps `libs` folder as expected, but it doesn't add the gradle line to make the app actually depend/use it. As a workaround, I need to build my own gradle file that does this, and add it via: `&lt;framework src="src/android/plugin.gradle" custom="true" type="gradleReference" /&gt;`

> I also tried adding the aar path to the `framework` but it expects it to be a folder with a `/build.gradle` present (e.g. it looks for `plugin.aar/build.gradle`). And the types found in the <https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/plugin_ref/spec.html#framework|docs> doesn't appear to indicate it actually supports android libraries. Perhaps this is a missing feature.
