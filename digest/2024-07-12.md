__@norman137__ says 
> I have plenty of native modules at work... so I foresee myself spending a lot of work hours in the coming weeks to do a lot more research on this issue as well testing and hopefully answer the following questions:
> 
> 1. Will 4kb page sized compiled modules in fact cause launch issues on 16kb page size emulators. (google says it probably will, so I'm assuming yes)
> 2. Is R27 NDK required to produce a compatible binary for 16kb page size emulators, or are there compiler flags available. (I do believe compiler flags are available, but if you rely on libstdc++, then the below point might be required)
> 3. Is R27 NDK required for the libstdc++ library for 16kb page size support. (I believe google stated R27 will be a requirement to have a 16kb page size support on the standard library, or you must static link which has other complications)
> 4. Will a 16kb page size binary run on a 4kb page size device (I would assume no, or if it does it will probably have degraded performance)
> Probably will end up writing a blog post on this topic once I learn more and can answer the above with more certainty.
