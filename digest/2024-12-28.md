__@hsn100718__ says 
> I am writing this message after reaching my breaking point with the ongoing, unacceptable delays in the promised support. This situation has repeated itself time and again, and every time we take a step forward, things seem to only get worse. The continuous delays blatantly expose the lack of planning and execution within your team, and clearly demonstrate a lack of professionalism in handling the issues your users face.
> You have made promises that have gone unsupported by any real action, and pretended that you would provide the support within the stated timelines. Sadly, nothing has come to fruition. These delays are not just an inconvenienceâ€”they are a betrayal to your users who rely on this tool for their professional projects. Your disregard for developers' needs is glaring with every unjustified delay.
> I demand an explanation for the ongoing neglect and delay. It is unacceptable that we continue to wait for a solution without any clear response or serious stance from your team. This chaos is beyond tolerable, and I expect an urgent reply that clearly outlines how and when this issue will be resolved, once and for all.
> This message is not merely a complaintâ€”it's a call for accountability and a clear explanation for your failure to deliver on what was promised.

__@hsn100718__ says 
> According to international and local consumer protection laws, delays in delivering promised services or products are considered violations of individuals' and businesses' rights who rely on these services. Under constitutional principles that guarantee citizens' rights to efficient and timely services, unexcused delays constitute a breach of justice and negatively impact economic and social progress.
> Many laws emphasize that any delay beyond a specified period must be compensated fairly, either through refunds or other forms of compensation. Timely delivery is part of the right to fair treatment and reliable service. Continued delays without justification violate these rights and call for necessary legal actions to ensure justice for those affected.

> @bigballi
> 
> I am absolutely fed up with your infuriating behavior! You respond to my messages and then disappear as if my time means nothing. Do you seriously think this behavior is acceptable or respectful? Let me be very clear: your actions are entirely unprofessional and show a blatant lack of respect for me and the responsibilities we are trying to accomplish.
> Your repeated behavior proves that you are either uninterested or indifferent, and both are completely unacceptable. If you believe you can ignore me like this and show up whenever you feel like it, you are gravely mistaken. No one has the time to sit around waiting for your sporadic responses that disrupt progress and create unnecessary frustration.
> If you cannot commit to proper and consistent communication, at least have the decency to say so, instead of playing games with other peopleâ€™s time and patience. I am demanding, clearly and firmly, that this childish behavior stops immediately.
> I expect a straightforward and final response from you, and I will not tolerate any further excuses or repeats of this behavior.

__@bigballi__ says 
> No one here has committed to anything, it's a community.
> At this point I am indeed uninterested and indifferent.
> I would advise reading previous messages and other threads on how others solved your issue.
> Best of luck!
