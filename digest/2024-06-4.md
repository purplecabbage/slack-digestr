__@norman137__ says 
> I don't really know what that plugin does exactly but natively apps that runs in a background typically don't have UI attached. They do so via a background service. Cordova apps runs in a webview, therefore they are very dependent on the UI being attached. So while running in the background the OS may detroy the UI for your app, which causes the webview to become destroyed, and thus your javascript runtime where your app lives.

> Not really sure what you're trying to do but background processing from within webview JS code will be severely limited I'm pretty sure.
