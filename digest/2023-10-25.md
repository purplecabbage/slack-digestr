__@info460__ says 
> As now splashscreen is inforced and I have to have one, I have a situation.
> The first page of my app use setTimeout(() =&gt; redirPage(), 6000);
> which is kind of welcome screen with automatic redirect.
> 
> The problem is that the duration of the splashscreen counts into the time of the timeout of the next page.
> Example: If my splashscreen is 5s long and my next page have redirect in 6s it will basically redirect after 1s the page is shown (6s -5s = 1s).
> 
> Obviously why dont add these 5 second to the setTimeout?
> The problem is that I have on the first page a nice effect (Kenburn) which is also set up for some duration.....
> 
> Is there a way how to disconnect the splashcreen duration from making effect on my next page?
> 
> sorry for messy explanation
