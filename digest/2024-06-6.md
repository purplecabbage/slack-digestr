__@nityasantosh.channoju__ says 
> Hello Everyone. I have encountered strange bug in my iOS application. So I am using cordova-plugin-simple-file-chooser for choosing documents/files and uploading.
> And I am not uploading the selected files to the server yet, they are still on the device. In iOS these files are stored in the tmp directory. I observed that it creates an additional directory within tmp with  name appID-Inbox. And the files put under that directory are removed within 60 seconds. Does anyone have any workaround or fix to solve this issue.
> 
> A observation that I had is, whenever the files/images selected from files of the devices the app puts them under tmp/appID-Inbox. Normal images selected from gallery are under tmp directory. The files under tmp directory are not removed within 60 seconds, These are removed when the app is inactive. I need this behavior for files and documents as well.
> Any suggestion would be helpful.
